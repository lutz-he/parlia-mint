# ParliaMint Detection

## Overview

This project is a prototype aimed at exploring topic detection methods and summarization models. The primary goal is to evaluate and experiment with various techniques to enhance the understanding and summarization of parliamentary data.

## Objectives

- **Prototype Development**: Create a foundational prototype for topic detection and summarization.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of different topic detection methods.
- **Experimentation**: Experiment with various summarization models to determine the most effective approaches.

## Features

- **Topic Detection**: Implement and test multiple methods for detecting topics within parliamentary data.
- **Summarization**: Develop and evaluate summarization models to generate concise summaries of the data.

## Usage

As this is a prototype, the usage instructions are subject to change based on ongoing evaluations and experiments. Please refer to the project documentation for the latest updates.


## Streamlit App Usage

To interact with the prototype, we have developed a Streamlit application that provides a user-friendly interface for topic detection and summarization.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ParliaMintDetection.git
    cd ParliaMintDetection
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the App

To start the Streamlit application, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Using the App

Once the app is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`. The app provides the following functionalities:

- **Upload Data**: Upload your parliamentary data in the supported format.
- **Topic Detection**: Select and apply different topic detection methods to your data.
- **Summarization**: Generate summaries of the detected topics using various summarization models.
- **Visualization**: View visual representations of the detected topics and summaries.

For detailed instructions on how to use each feature, please refer to the in-app guidance and tooltips.

### Example

Here is a quick example of how to use the app:

1. **Upload your data**: Click on the "Browse files" button and select your data file.
2. **Select a topic detection method**: Choose a method from the dropdown menu.
3. **Generate summaries**: Click on the "Summarize" button to generate summaries of the detected topics.
4. **View results**: Explore the results through the provided visualizations and summary texts.

Feel free to experiment with different methods and parameters to see how they affect the results.
