      "{'sequence': 'Bruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): The next item is the debate on the legislative proposal 35984, Amendment of the budget statement of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science for the year 2022, the incidental supplementary budget for the acquisition of artwork. I would like to welcome the Secretary of State for Culture and Media to the First Chamber. You are here in the First Chamber as the first ruler of the new cabinet. I wish you every success in your work as Secretary of State.\\nI give the floor to Mrs Veldhoen on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.\\nVeldhoen, Gala (GL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is good that we are having this debate today, on the first Chamber day of this new year. I just heard that after hundreds of years of Binnenhof this is the first meeting out there. It is also the first debate of this new ruler. It\\'s a special moment. We are pleased with a cultural historian in this place. I would therefore like to welcome her to this house and wish her every success in this position, and of course have fun. Before I go any further, in the context of transparency, I would like to mention that I am a member of the complaints committee of the Association Rembrandt. That is an independent complaints committee and I will change myself if there is a complaint concerning the purchase of this work of art or its contribution. That is why I feel unhindered and free to speak on behalf of my group today. And I\\'d be happy to. I grew up in an artist\\'s family. Rembrandt was poured into me with the spoon by my father, and thus the admiration for his work. However, my group is quite critical of this proposed purchase, especially because of the timing in relation to the costs. This means that my group needs some comfort for a proper consideration as to what this Secretary of State intends to do for the cultural sector, especially as regards thezzp\\'ers in that sector, the independent artists, theatre makers, actors, musicians and technicians. It remains a bitter contradiction. While the cultural sector is fighting for its survival and manyzzp\\'ers in that sector live around or even below the poverty line, 150 million euros is spent on one painting. Where we spend money on a maker of the past, we don\\'t do it for today\\'s makers and for the makers of the future. Thezzp\\'ers in the cultural sector were already in a precarious position at the start of the corona crisis, and that position has deteriorated enormously. Their income fell by about 55%, while the average income was not that high, i.e. a small €25,000. Thesezzp\\'ers now live below the poverty line. The so-called trickle-down effect of the measures has not been achieved, according to the Boekmanstichting. The money didn\\'t end up with the makers. The policy has failed in this respect. Does the Secretary of State agree with me? According to the Culture Council, an additional 100 million per year is needed to solve the structural underpayment ofzzp\\'s in the sector. What will this Secretary of State do to ensure that the position of thesezzp\\'ers improves in the short term? Quite specifically, is the Secretary of State prepared to say, for example, that there will be a safety net for thesezzp\\'ers? This is also important for non-culture miners. Let us not forget that this sector is of great economic importance not only in terms of its content but also in terms of its economic importance. The CPB estimated for the corona crisis that the importance of the creative and cultural sector is greater than is often thought. The national, provincial and local authorities invest around EUR 4 billion in culture every year. This brings an annual added value of 25.5 billion, around 3.7% of GDP. Let\\'s get that straight. Apart from the value of culture in terms of content, which we naturally put first, it is simply also a very good investment. With this €25.5 billion, this sector is slightly smaller than the construction sector and twice as large as the agricultural sector. The creative sector is good for about 320,000 jobs. That is 4.5% of total employment. This sector is now completely undressed. People have been looking for new jobs out of desperation. What does this crisis mean for the sector, for the makers of today and future generations, but also for the sector as an employer and as an economic strength? The cultural sector is also lagging behind in recent measures. The cabinet chooses to open the construction markets and the IKEA, but not the museums. What signal is it sending? The sector feels orphaned. Is this Secretary of State going to stand up for this sector, and we sincerely hope that this sector will stand up for it, with a firm and loud voice emphasising the importance of this sector, because culture matters? And not just the culture of the old ministers. As far as my group is concerned, it is time for our political leaders to express their views on this matter. I therefore urge the Secretary of State to make a loud and clear statement today in line with my speech on the importance of our contemporary cultural sector and, of course, to make the necessary investments in it in the coming years. I\\'d like to hear a response. In November, the Vendrik motion was adopted in this Chamber, which calls for a recovery plan for the cultural and creative sector. It also calls on the government to consider mobilising funding from the European recovery programme. We would like to hear from the Secretary of State what the first ideas are about this recovery plan. When can we expect concrete steps? If the 170 million from the coalition agreement is sufficient to start this recovery, we wonder. My group does not think so. The question then is how this recovery programme will be financed. Does this cabinet, for example, intend to allocate funds from the European programme of recovery to culture, as countries such as France, Italy and Austria do and to which the European Parliament also calls? That would amount to 120 million for the Netherlands. But even if you add that 120 million to the 170 million from the government agreement, you are far from getting the amount that the Culture Council considers necessary to ensure that everyone in the Netherlands can practice and experience culture, and that everyone in the sector is paid properly. The Culture Council calls for an annual increase of 477 million in investment in the arts, heritage, libraries and the media. I therefore conclude that the 170 million for the whole sector is only a drop in the ocean. Is this Secretary of State going to make an effort to label money from the Cultural Restoration Fund? Can the Secretary of State also explain more fundamentally how it views the financing of the cultural sector? Finally, my group has a number of questions about the purchase. Does the Netherlands really need another Rembrandt? Shouldn\\'t the look be widened? Because no matter how much Rembrandt\\'s work is appreciated, even by my group, it is a purchase that shows a conservative view of our art-historical canon. For the same reason, a multitude of art from under-represented artists could be bought. What does the Secretary of State intend to do about this? Does the government have a balancing framework or a strategy in place in this respect? An important question: isn\\'t too much paid for the Rembrandt? This weekend was still in a big piece in NRC Handelsblad: it is more than twice the highest amount ever paid for a Dutch master. France abandoned it for this price. Is this price real? Do you have to participate as a country in the international madness at the art market, where price increases lead to additional costs for museums? Insurance costs, borrowing costs and security costs: all these costs will increase, leading to a reduction in the value of education and exhibitions. How does the Secretary of State appreciate this? And how is it going to ensure that the cultural sector, and not just the Rijksmuseum, takes full advantage of this work? What arrangements will the Secretary of State make with the Rijksmuseum in this respect? I\\'m closing up. Culture and the creative industry are included in the government agreement in the chapter \"prosperous country,\" together with entrepreneurship, innovation and digitalisation. The future will show whether the new political impetus of Rutte IV will also lead to the necessary revaluation. That\\'s about a lot more than just money. It is about the political will to make choices that stimulate the arts and the creative sector. My group hopes that this Secretary of State will become a banner of a more ambitious and respectful cultural policy. We await the answers with interest.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs Veldhoen. I now give the floor to Mr Frentrop on behalf of the Forum for Democracy.\\nFrentrop, Paul (FvD): Mr. Chairman. Today it is not about whether the painting De Vaandelbearer van Rembrandt is a beautiful painting. Everyone can find their own. This room isn\\'t about that. It\\'s not about whether the painting De Vaandelblader is important to the Netherlands, although there are enough indications that it is not, because it was hanging in a private collection for years on a castle in France without the Netherlands being affected. It wasn\\'t easy to sell either, because in France you have to offer such a painting to French people first. It\\'s been on the market for two years. Turns out no Frenchman wanted it. Then it turned out that there were Dutch people who wanted to buy it. That in itself is still no reason for this Chamber to interfere in the matter, because if a wealthy Dutchman had bought the painting, the group of Forum for Democracy would have congratulated him on the purchase, but there would have been no need for any further interference from this Chamber. If the Rijksmuseum had set up a crowdfunding action to encourage the Dutch to make a contribution to the purchase of the work, then Forum voor Democracy would have supported that action, but the parliament would not have had to do anything. However, the previous Minister of Education, Culture and Science decided to use tax money to buy De Vaandelblader. It will then be a matter for this Chamber, because we are looking at the efficiency of public expenditure. How do we do that? Let me quote a prime minister whose achievements are generally admired. \"I have always been aware that we take away from people every guilder we spend as a government and that we should not use their money lightly. One has to deal with public funds as one gentleman handles the money of another, namely even more carefully than with his own money.\" Was signed: Willem Drees. A more recent quote also applies. This is from the emergency letter sent by the General Court to the House of Representatives last week. \"Audience money is always scarce. Alternative use is always possible: alternative expenditure, improvement of the balance or return to the taxpayer.\" Mr. Chairman. But now the government wants to buy a painting with scarce public money. I dare say that Willem Drees would not have spent 175 million euros, almost 400 million guilders in his time, to buy De Vaandelbearer. This amounts to almost €20 per Dutch family, just as the Nibud has calculated that purchasing power for families will fall by €40 per month this year. Mr. Chairman. Here the Dutch elite is smug enough to give each other an expensive gift, purchased with other people\\'s money, with tax money. A First Chamber that takes care to ensure the quality of administration and legislation should not agree to this. We often talk about tax morals here. Recently, in the Financial Reviews by Mr Vendrik van GroenLinks, it was explicitly mentioned that we expect citizens and businesses to pay a decent tax and not all of them to hire expensive advisors to avoid things. They shouldn\\'t minimize their payments. But the downside of the tax morality that we expect from citizens and businesses is that we, the government and the parliament, are also going to use morality when we are going to spend that tax money again. If we do this carelessly, it will harm the citizens\\' tax morals. For that reason alone, wise politicians would not think about simply buying an expensive painting. Mr. Chairman. In addition to this appeal to all members of this Chamber to vote against this bill, the Forum for Democracy Group also has three questions for the new Secretary of State. The first question concerns the high risk involved in such an expensive purchase. In the past these risks were mainly the check if the painting was real and if it hadn\\'t been in the sun for too long, but nowadays there are still more risks. In the case of such an investment, it is necessary to check whether the painting is wokeproof in our modern terms. If Rembrandt ever found out that he might have had a slave who cared for his garden, then an investment of 175 million euros would disappear immediately into the Rijksmuseum\\'s depot room. That risk is not imaginary, so it is real. After all, the work of art was painted in the Golden Age. \"Golden Age\" is, as we know, a term that the Amsterdam museum has not used since 2019. According to the museum, the term \"Golden Age\" is linked to national pride, but the many negative aspects of the seventeenth century are ignored, such as poverty, war, forced labour and human trafficking. Well, Mr. Chairman. The banner bearer also exudes national pride and it also ignores poverty, war and slavery. So the risk is high that this painting hurts people. How acute that risk is, it turned out last week. Then the king told us in a video message: the Golden Coach will not be able to drive again until the Netherlands is ready and that is not the case now. The question that is now being asked, a 175 million euro question, is: is the Netherlands ready for De Vaandelblader? Did the Secretary of State investigate that? Then there is the second question. It concerns the procedure. Under the rule of the minister who wanted to buy this painting, the level of Dutch education has fallen further. But what that minister did, that was a firm commitment to policy against bullying at school. For example, we know the annual week against bullying, this year on 26 September. Now I\\'ve consulted a plague expert myself. He told me that an important beginning of bullying behavior is that sometimes all classmates are invited to a party except one. I had to think about that when I heard that former Minister Van Engelshoven, before she went to buy this gift, informed all the political groups in the House of Representatives confidentially, except for one. My second question is to the Secretary of State who followed her in the field of culture: how does she judge that choice of her predecessor? I actually hope the Secretary of State shares my view that this behaviour was a bit clumsy. In that case, as far as I am concerned, we can leave this issue to rest here. But if she does not share my opinion, I would like to hear from the Secretary of State whether the cabinet has an opinion on the probe policy pursued by the previous Minister. Finally, a third question. This calls on the Secretary of State to make art procurement policy more future-proof. Would it be an idea to draw up a list of all the artifacts currently in private hands that the Dutch government believes could ever be eligible to be bought with tax money, if appropriate? This is actually a list of potential national art possessions. Such a list is not only useful to remove the arbitrariness from the art purchasing policy. Impulse purchases are then avoided. But what Forum for Democracy would like to see is that we involve the broad Dutch population in drawing up such a list. If we do that, it will also provide support for the entire art procurement policy. Anyone can say: those are beautiful things that we would like to have from taxpayers\\' money. This also has a positive impact on tax morals, as I have outlined earlier, because then we will certainly know how the money is spent. And not unimportant to education: drawing up such a list also has an educational aspect. It teaches the people about our national art history. My third and final question is therefore: would the Secretary of State be prepared to consider drawing up such a list? Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Frentrop. Mr Otten has an interruption.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): I have a question for Mr Frentrop. If I am right, your House of Representatives has asked some thirty questions about the purchase of this painting, of which ten are about the Rothschild family and what they are going to do with the proceeds of the painting, with very suggestive questions about their involvement in globalist networks etc. I personally get a really weird taste in the mouth of these kinds of questions. Could Mr Frentrop perhaps explain why the Forum for Democracy is so obsessed with the background of the seller?\\nFrentrop, Paul (FvD): No, Mr Frentrop can\\'t do that. Those are questions from the Lower House Group. They still have to be answered. So you need to be with the House of Representatives for that.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Yes, but your party has also made a comprehensive statement on its website, in which the identity of the seller is particularly emphasised. Some say it\\'s bordering on anti-Semitism. What is your position on that?\\nFrentrop, Paul (FvD): One of the special things I remember the other day at the end of the year, which we introduced as a Forum for Democracy in Dutch politics, is that we created our own opposition in the First Chamber. Mr Otten is now asking questions on a subject that he finds interesting and fascinating, but which is of course a bit off the subject we are discussing today: the purchase of De Vandelblader with tax money. So I would suggest that you keep topics such as racism, anti-Semitism, statements by the House of Representatives, things like the word I am not allowed to use here, President, namely \\'tribunals\\', all for where they belong. If you wish to oppose the Forum for Democracy here in this First Chamber, you may do so, but let us do so on a subject-by-issue basis.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Finally, Mr. Otten.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): No, your party makes this a very big thing. That has nothing to do with opposition. I\\'m just asking, why does your party do that? Because that has caused a lot of unrest in Jewish circles. And I\\'ll understand that when I see how it\\'s done. That has nothing to do with opposition. I\\'m just asking you, are you behind this or are you renouncing this kind of insinuation?\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Finally, Mr. Frentrop. Then we return to the bill.\\nFrentrop, Paul (FvD): I would like to refer again to the Lower House Group, chairman.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you. Mrs Prast has the floor on behalf of the Animal Party.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): Mr. Chairman. First of all, of course, a warm welcome to the new Secretary of State. The Party for Animals considers it very important that more public money goes to art and culture. Art stimulates people to think outside beaten paths and is the starting point for transformation, change and innovation. My group only welcomes an additional EUR 150 million for art and culture, but the question is whether this money should be spent on the purchase of De Vaandelblader and whether we are sufficiently informed to take a decision on this today. There would be hijackers on the coast, \"the amount is reasonable,\" \"there\\'s a hurry.\" Is that so? In an interview with Het Parool, the director of the Rijksmuseum said that the French Government had announced its intention to issue an export licence, I quote Mr Dibbits \"provided that the work ends up in the public domain\\'. This makes it very implausible that the 2018 valuation price is even higher, that there are hijackers on the coast that are pushing up the price and that there is a hurry. The Secretary of State writes that she is not immediately aware of whether there are other interested parties and, if so, how many, but that the director of the Rijksmuseum expects at least ten others to want to buy the work. Mr. Chairman. Wanting to buy something is one thing, buying something is another thing. Private collectors have ample resources, but are excluded because of the condition imposed by the French Government. Are there at least ten other museums willing to pay such a high price and, if so, are they already able to act at the end of January? That\\'s unthinkable, isn\\'t it? That the Secretary of State is not directly aware of whether there are other interested parties and, if so, how many, of course cannot. That should have been figured out, especially now that it is inappropriate, given the conditions for the export licence. In response to the questions of the OCW committee, the Secretary of State writes that top works from the oeuvre of the most important artists have been sought by collectors all over the world. She calls the card players of Cézanne and Salvator Mundi of Da Vinci, but they were bought by private collectors. Those things aren\\'t going to happen now. The Salvator Mundi is probably not Da Vinci\\'s, but that aside. If there are no private hijackers on the coast, why the flying rush? If there are no buyers insisting, then it will have an impact on the price, or that should have an impact on that. Why isn\\'t the evaluation report attached to the documents? Has the valuation in 2018 taken into account the condition that the painting should enter the public domain? That condition justifies a new valuation because the market looks very different, doesn\\'t it? The government writes about the intended purchase: \"The Vaandelbearer is inextricably linked to the history of the Netherlands. Vandelbearers walked before the troops in the Eighty Years\\' War, which led to the birth of the Netherlands.\" Mr. Chairman. The banner bearer bears a prominent Javanese criss. Why isn\\'t it mentioned? Indonesia is also inextricably linked to our history, isn\\'t it? There has been a lot of social and cultural unrest in the art world in recent years. Another Javanese kris recently became publicized, because the minister of OCW who, in the context of restitution of predatory art two years ago, handed over to Indonesia from the national collection. Of course, the Vandelbearer is not a predatory art. But has there been any mention in the context of the proposed purchase of the picture of the criss and of its possible negative impact, including on the interest of other museums and thus on the market value? If not, why not? If so, what was the outcome and why wasn\\'t it shared with us? Mr. Chairman. There\\'s a lot of essential information missing. That alone stands in the way of saying \"yes\" at the moment. Without hijackers on the coast, there\\'s no rush. Besides, how necessary is purchase anyway? The Minister wrote in her proposal to the House of Representatives that she hopes that the purchase will allow as many people as possible to enjoy the painting. I saw De Vaandeldrager in the Rijksmuseum when it was part of the exhibition Rembrandt-Velázquez in 2019 and 2020. In 1991 the painting also hung there, at the exhibition \"Rembrandt, the master and his workshop.\" Is purchase necessary? Can\\'t we get a loan or a joint purchase, like Marten and Oopjen? Recently, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam together with Kunstmuseum Bern acquired a beautiful work by El Anatsui. Has it been investigated whether joint purchase was possible? If not, why not? If so, what was the outcome and why was the Chamber not informed? Mr. Chairman. In our view, the Chamber is currently not sufficiently informed to be able to say \\'yes\\' to the proposed purchase. The haste is motivated by the risk of hijackers on the coast, but if there are and if so, how many, the Secretary of State does not know himself. The price level is based on a market with private collectors, while they cannot compete. We have not been able to discuss possible other, less expensive ways to display the painting in the Netherlands, and that while there is a great need for more money for innovative art and culture, for museums that reveal neglected aspects of history, for art that appeals to more than just the older elite and to a better position forzzp\\'ers in the cultural sector. It would be nice if the increase in the budget could be used at least partly for this purpose and De Vaandelbearer could possibly be brought to the Netherlands in a different, less costly way, by regular loan or together with another museum. Our group therefore proposes that we do not vote today, because voting in favour on the basis of incomplete information does not bear the responsibility of the Chamber. Mr. Chairman. I look forward to the Secretary of State\\'s answers.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs. Prast. I now give the floor to Mr Janssen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): Mr. Chairman. I would also like to begin by congratulating the Secretary of State on her appointment on behalf of my group. My group is looking forward to fruitful cooperation. You\\'re very welcome. Today it is a rather strange treatment of this bill, because the predecessor of the Secretary of State did the treatment in the Lower House. This makes it impossible to question the outgoing minister on her answers in the legislative consultation. On the other hand, it allows the Secretary of State to choose her own answers in the course of the proceedings in the Upper Chamber. Mr. President, the painting. The painting has been on sale since 2018. Is it true, I ask the Secretary of State, that the Netherlands already in 2019 applied for an export permit for the painting and wanted to purchase it? At least that is what I derive from the Minister\\'s reply to the legislative consultation in the Lower House. If this is true, why hasn\\'t financial space been set aside before, and why should we now debate it so urgently? And why is Parliament being so attacked with the deadline that has been set? In the context of transparency, I must also ask the current State Secretary whether, in 2018, as a member of the council of advice of the Association Rembrandt, she was involved in advising on the purchase of this painting. Following that, I also have the question of whether the Secretary of State, as a member of the Board of Advisor of the Association Rembrandt, which is co-financed, had knowledge of the proposed purchase that is now pending. Was the Secretary of State asked at that time to consider a position within the cabinet on behalf of D66? I think it\\'s good to clarify this timeline. The painting has been surrounded by superlatives in the last month and a half and let me just mention it as it is.. with grandspeak. \"It\\'s now or never,\" according to the former minister, and the director of the Rijksmuseum wants to \"get to the limit\" to buy the painting. Now that is far from it, because in the five years that the director said he was in the process of purchasing, he has not managed to arrange the necessary funding other than with a handful of public funds. So many big words, and that at a time when the successors of Rembrandt, thezzp\\'ers in the here and now, sit with their hands in their hair and cannot keep their heads above water. In large numbers, due to a lack of government support, they have already had to take the lead. They\\'re running away. They\\'re forced to go to other sectors. We\\'ve seen that before. They\\'re not coming back. We\\'ve seen that before when under Minister Opstelten thousands of police officers were fired that we can\\'t get back. We saw it in the financial crisis, when mass redundancies in construction workers made sure that we now have a shortage of people. Mr. Chairman. At a time like this, the release of EUR 131 million from the general budget by a government without problems is a blow to the face of all thosezzp\\'ers in the art sector who feel abandoned. Beyond the remark that, in view of the crisis we are now in, the moment was \\'extremely unhappy\\', the Minister did not come. She also referred to the new cabinet. That is why my group is asking the Secretary of State what they have to offer these people, who have been in trouble for so long, and at what time. Because they haven\\'t been reached in this crisis before. Mr Veldhoen has already mentioned this. At the Coronaper Conference last Friday, the cultural sector was again at the bottom of the list, although the Prime Minister still existed to call the art and culture sector \"priority\" at the end of the press conference. Priority, you have to dare, because here too, words matter. Mr. Chairman. A purchase price of 175 million also sets the standard for future purchases by museums. I can imagine that with frowning eyebrows this amount is being looked at and many museums are worried. For the purchase of De Vaandeldrager, without prior consultation with the museums, the cabinet also unilaterally excluded 19 million euros from the National Museum Purchase Fund. Furthermore, I cannot escape the impression that the asking price has determined the market value. When the painting temporarily hung in the Rijksmuseum in 2018 and 2019, at the exhibition Rembrandt-Velázquez, the value was estimated at 165 million euros. But it\\'s been on sale for over a year. That was also the time when the Netherlands wanted to buy the painting. Can the Secretary of State explain the order of things again? Was there first the asking price and then the valuation looked at whether that asking price could be substantiated? Or did the valuation determine the asking price? Reference is made to the developments in the art market, but in fact it is a market of \"what the madman gives for it,\" just to say it popularly. There is an increasing number of people who are not prevented from spending hundreds of millions. If we have to take that into account in valuations, it\\'s the dam\\'s fence. It is worth it in itself, not in this debate, but in the foreseeable future, to hold a debate with the Secretary of State on how we should deal with this in general. You could call it almost capitalist predatory art. We should talk to each other about this kind of excrement for these amounts. How should we deal with this in the future? This cannot continue if we want to shape our own policies. Does the Secretary of State share my view that we should have a more in-depth discussion about this in the foreseeable future than just today about the purchase of this work of art? Mr. Chairman. I am pleased that my party colleague Kwint in the Lower House has received a positive ruling in the Chamber on a first right to purchase when the royal family decides to sell works. After all, a few years ago we were still uncomfortablely surprised when, despite requests from The Hague, a number of members of the Royal House preferred to offer their private collection for sale via Sotheby\\'s. Can the Secretary of State indicate when we can look forward to a proposal to implement this motion? Mr. Chairman. I\\'m closing up. Artists think differently about the painting itself. I\\'m not an art historian, so I don\\'t want to assume any substantive judgment today. I note, however, that there is a division between experts of name and fame as to whether this purchase is really necessary in terms of content. The question is also raised how bad it would be if we did not acquire this painting. In addition, there is great concern about the consequences of the price to be paid for the painting and its impact on other museums in the future. In this way, it is not yet settled for my group in the First Chamber that this purchase will be given our consent. Of course, I look forward first to the answer to my questions by the Secretary of State. Thank you.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Janssen. I now give the floor to Mrs Fiers on behalf of the Labour Party.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): First of all, on behalf of the Labour Party, a warm welcome to the new Secretary of State. Mr. Chairman. Timing is everything. Musicians, sound engineers, filmmakers and actors work with timing on a daily basis. For them, timing determines the difference between success and glorious oblivion. The timing of the purchase of De Vandelbrugger is miserable and is hard on the stomach of many in the cultural and creative sector and beyond. The timing is poor in relation to the effects of the still ongoing corona measures in the cultural sector. The situation has been said by a number of speakers, especially in the case of Of course, there were and are generic and specific corona measures for the cultural sector. Last year\\'s Boekmanstichting (Boekmanstichting) (\\'Bookmanstichting\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\') (\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\') (\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\') (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\') (\\'Bookman) (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (Bookmans Foundation) (\\'s Foundation) (\\'Bookmans Foundation) (\\'s Foundation) (Bookman) (Bookmans Foundation) (\\'s Foundation) (\\'s Foundation) (Bookman) (\\'s Foundation) (\\'s Foundation) (\\'s Foundation) (\\'s Foundation) (\\'s Foundation) (Bookmans Foundation) The previous Minister for Culture also noted with regret that these measures have not been sufficiently implemented by those creators. What\\'s the deal with thosezzp\\'ers in the cultural sector? For me, Education, Culture and Science is a new domain. I have to say that I was shocked by the fact that in the Netherlands on average 12% of all workers are employees and that in the cultural sector this is as much as 60%. That really scared the shit out of me. It is by far the sector with the highest percentage of the Netherlands. The abolition of the Tozo, the temporary bridging scheme for self-employed entrepreneurs, for example, affects all those working in culture. The PvdA Group believes that this is not only a threat to those independent entrepreneurs and any partners and children, but also a threat to the cultural sector as a whole. I\\'d like a reflection from the State Secretary on this. Does she share our opinion? Today we are talking about an investment of 150 million in the work of a former creator. With today\\'s creators, who are threatening to go under and are forced to leave the sector, this feels unfair. I think everyone can make a show out of that. It would not be the cultural sector! It\\'s gonna be fun action. Just like the spontaneous action of Anne Ermens. This 33-year-old vocal teacher from Breda made his own creative version of Rembrandt\\'s Vaandelblader, made of 315 portrait photos of cultural makers. In Anne\\'s version of Rembrandt\\'s self-portrait 315 pair of eyes from contemporary artmakers look at the viewer. It would be nice if Anne\\'s artwork over a number of years could symbolize a fundamental revaluation of the value of cultural makers in our society. Anne has very specific ideas about that. I\\'d like to invite the Secretary of State to see if she can come up with a plan for that with Anne. Mr. Chairman. However, the new coalition agreement offers prospects for the future of the cultural sector. Structurally, 170 million euros per year will be added. That\\'s more than welcome. Our group also welcomes the substantive priorities set out in the coalition agreement. An important priority is to improve the labour market position, including a fair salary, for creators throughout the cultural and creative sector. The government agreement also announces a recovery plan to help the sector get back on track after the damage caused and continues to be caused by the pandemic and measures. With the new coalition agreement, there is hope for the future, but as Amsterdam\\'s alderman Jan Schaeffer once said, you cannot live in bullshit. Similarly, you don\\'t want a plan in the coalition agreement now that you can pay daily groceries and rent, let alone the gas bill. A recovery plan for the sector makes little sense if the crew, thezzp\\'ers, has already left the sinking ship. If all thosezzp\\'ers are forced to leave the sector, the recovery plan for the sector may be too late. Therefore, please have a reflection of the state secretary on the current needs of thezzp\\'ers in the cultural sector in relation to the recovery plan. Does it perhaps see the opportunity, because of the large number of Zpp\\'s, to make a temporary safety net scheme for thezzp\\'ers in the cultural sector? We are considering tabling a motion for this, but we are very much looking forward to the reaction of the Secretary of State. So much for the situation of thezzp\\'ers. Oh, there\\'s someone over there. I have a new pair of glasses, so I need to get used to the varifocus level.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): That is Mr Van Kesteren of the PVV Group. I would like to give Mr Van Kesteren the floor for an interruption. Go ahead.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): I would like to ask the spokesman for the Labour Party whether she is quoting Mr Schaeffer correctly: you cannot live in a shithole. I think the word was different.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): No. We can do historiography about that, but it\\'s not what you think. I wouldn\\'t do that word here anyway. You know that.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I wouldn\\'t tolerate that either. I do not think that the debate should be considered lost without this noun. Go ahead.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): I have chosen the right word in the context of the brutality. First of all, the painting itself and the tour through the Netherlands. On social media, someone described the painting as \"a proud selfie,\" from 1636. Rembrandt was, you might say, also a starting artist at the time. Azzp\\'er who could sell his work through the studio of the art dealer Uylenburgh in Amsterdam. In the same year Rembrandt made De Vaandeldrager, he met the niece of the art dealer Saskia van Uylenburgh. She came from Leeuwarden and was the mayor\\'s daughter. That\\'s something our Senator Ferd Crone doesn\\'t want to leave unmentioned. That\\'s why this is in there for a while. The couple later married in Friesland. His wonderful, cheerful and self-conscious selfie, De Vaandelbearer, is therefore perhaps to be traced back to his early crush. Saskia of Uylenburgh was his first love and was a model for some of his important works. They\\'ll be together ten years if she dies. For the PvdA group, the fact that De Vaandelbearer is finally back in public hands with this purchase is the main argument for a possible purchase. The planned tour of Rembrandt by the Netherlands also gives us a positive view, because this increases the chance that all Dutch people can look at this special work of art. Rembrandt is coming to us this summer, you might say. That\\'s very nice. Perhaps Rembrandt, as a young artist in love, should begin his tour in Leeuwarden, the birthplace of his beloved. Or maybe he should finish his tour there and maybe stay there. It is a matter of rethinking, but perhaps it could counter the current political divide between the Randstad and the region. I wonder what the Secretary of State thinks of this thought. With this huge purchase amount, the Dutch taxpayer has already paid the free entrance ticket, you would say. A motion of the SP that advocates a free entry ticket for all Dutch people has been held in the Lower House. We would like to hear from this new Secretary of State how she intends to complete the principle of maximum accessibility as promised by her predecessor and at what time. Thirdly, the valuation. The answers to our written questions show that this purchase was based on the expertise of an internationally renowned specialist in the field of old masters and that no legal requirements are imposed on valuations underlying purchases. In my daily work I have a lot to do with land and real estate valuations. There we work with very strict requirements regarding, for example, the clientship of the valuation, the four-eyed principle........................................................................................................................................................................................... I would like to hear from the Secretary of State how she looks at the current method of valuation of art purchases. I would like to hear whether she sees room for improvement and whether she thinks it wise to make demands here in the future. Fourthly, I would like to focus on future purchases. The Netherlands Collection is never finished. So new paintings will always be bought. Looking at the purchases of the last ten years, it is striking that the purchases are rather unevenly distributed across the Netherlands. Most purchases take place for and through museums in the Randstad. Critics also indicate that these purchases involve the great name sickness, which means as much as staring blindly at big names like Rembrandt and ignoring the many other female and non-Western artists, who are also rich in our art history. What does the Secretary of State think of this criticism? Does she recognize this? How can the Secretary of State ensure that the top works from the Netherlands Collection can be seen more widely across the country and give a more pluralistic picture of our art history? Finally, Mr President. I have often wondered when preparing for this debate what Rembrandt would have thought of all this. I suspect that in the first instance he would be greatly shocked by the large amount paid for De Vaandelbearer. Perhaps he would also be charmed by the idea of giving De Vandelbearer a place in the birthplace of his first love. Or maybe he, like me, would have been touched by the 315 pair of eyes of the contemporary artwork in the version of Anne Ermens. I look forward to the Secretary of State\\'s answers.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs Fiers. Mrs. Prast.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): Now that the colleague seems to know a lot about valuation, I am curious to know her assessment of the fact that the artwork has to come into the public domain, which is a condition of the French, and what that means for the value of the 2018 valuation.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): I consider myself expert in the field of land and real estate. I\\'ve always learned to stick to your expertise. So I\\'m looking forward to seeing how the Secretary of State describes the way in which art works. I certainly think that the fact that nothing has been laid down leads to a great deal of confusion. I think it\\'s wise anyway, and then I\\'m looking at the future in particular to record more things about how you do that valuation. Otherwise, we have discussions with each other on whether or not it meets the requirements. If we are debating the future, I think it would certainly be wise to record more things about the valuation than are now in the answers.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you. I now give the floor to Mr Schalk on behalf of the Group of the European People\\'s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): Thank you, Mr President. Welcome to the Secretary of State, who\\'s been watching this wonderful work of art behind me all day. Art isn\\'t always what it looks like, you know that. Some people think it represents the twelve provinces, but in my humble opinion, that upper right plane in the orange color guarantees the SGP. In other words, it\\'s just how we look at art. Mr. Chairman. Once upon a time, I was allowed to lay my hand on the banner of the then regiment of supply and disposal troops. As a young reserve officer, you had to step out and stand in front of the commander. Then you put your left hand on the banner stick, the right hand was raised, and if you take the oath, so help me God almighty. I was reminded of this moment when I was preparing this debate. By the way, the banner carrier was a very important person in a city guard or a fence, and also in the armed forces. It was not an enviable position, for such a banner could hardly defend itself, while it was obviously the enemy\\'s duty to bring down that banner. Are those the things that haunted the head of the 30-year-old Rembrandt, while he set up the first sketches for The Vandelbearer, this phenomenal painting? Has he wanted to show some of the fearlessness that a banner carrier must have in order to remain virtually unarmed in battle? Or a whole other question. From Rembrandt\\'s oeuvre, we can see that he was a believer. Would the well-known statement that Christians fought under the banner of Christ have played through his head? Or should he perhaps think of that psalm: we will rejoice at your salvation and raise the shares in the name of our God? We all don\\'t know. By thinking about it, the artwork gets more value. But 175 million is a lot. Is it known what the last owner paid for the painting? And what does that amount, which undoubtedly was much lower, mean for the price it should pay now? Again, it\\'s a phenomenal amount. In the documents I came across the question as to whether the State of the Netherlands would now earn or lose through the purchase. I liked the answer. If the purchase continues, the State of the Netherlands will exchange a sum of 150 million for a painting with a purchase value of 175 million. Trades: a sort of barter. Next, the Ministry reports that the value of the painting will not become visible in the budget administration, because the Empire uses a cash liability system, and not an income-burden system, in which the value of the painting would be part of its own capital. Of course, that\\'s a fact, but it does raise a few questions. What is the expectation as to the value of this painting in the future? Is it true that we can assume that the painting could be made again? Is it really an option to use such a painting as a trade object in case of emergency? Let\\'s talk about funding. Third-party funds are supposedly coming in, namely the contribution of the Rembrandt Association of 15 million, 10 million from the Rijksmuseum, and 19 million from the Museum Purchase Fund. In total, that\\'s 44 million. The trade which has just been mentioned was about 150 million. Does the Secretary of State refer to the deduction of the purchase amount from the contributions of two out of three thirds, namely the Rembrandt Association for 15 million and the Rijksmuseum for 10 million? The contribution of the Museum Purchase Fund is not taken into account here. Is that why they\\'re public money? Shouldn\\'t we consider the Rijksmuseum\\'s money to be public money, too? Mr. Chairman. Money is important, but we are talking about art and culture. In the purchase of Marten and Oopjen, two paintings by the student painter at the time, for 160 million, I said the following. \"The SGP is positive about art that remains within certain limits and about artists who make true art with their gifts and talents given by God. Those artists have been there over the centuries, some of which deserve our special attention. That includes Rembrandt. His paintings have an unprecedented beauty. Often they are biblical scenes or motifs with a strong symbolic value. In addition, his works of art have left something that takes time. This is about timeless, universal beauty.\" My group is also looking at some consistency now, the SGP is not strange about this first painting by the master painter Rembrandt van Rijn. I understand it\\'s very difficult to ignore such a painting by your nose. If it were bought by a wealthy family, it is in any case not available and accessible to the Dutch public for a very long time. But if it does become available, it is important to really make it possible to get to know it. How will the Secretary of State ensure broad public availability, unlike the Rijksmuseum\\'s Honor Gallery, where a visitor pays €20 for a ticket? Mr. Chairman. I look forward to the Secretary of State\\'s answers.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Schalk. I shall then give the floor to Mr Janssen van de SP for an interruption.\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): I have a brief question for Mr Schalk. Mr Schalk asked about the purchase price paid by the current owner. That was £840 at an auction in 1840 paid by one of the ancestors.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): Thank you for the information.\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): Well, that wasn\\'t a paroleal acquaintance of mine either, you know. That\\'s what I found in the preparation. Now, my question is whether the increase from £840 to €175 million makes any difference to the assessment of whether or not to buy this painting.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): Mr Janssen asks exactly what I asked the Secretary of State. Let me quote what I have here. Any word on what the last owner paid? And what does that amount mean for today\\'s price? I am therefore very curious to hear the answer from the Secretary of State. If the painting has experienced such an enormous increase in value, what does that mean for us?\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): Now Mr Schalk of the Secretary of State is going back to us. But my question is whether it makes a difference for the SGP in the valuation of the proposed purchase if we know that the price went from £840 to €175 million.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): I don\\'t think that would make exactly the difference. Everyone knew in advance that... By the way, I\\'m curious what Rembrandt sold it for himself. Maybe the Secretary of State knows that too, or Mr. Janssen, who apparently knows more about art than I do. I have used this point to make it clear that there is apparently something huge going on in this whole cultural sector, in this case with regard to such a piece of heritage. The question is whether that has anything to do with the government, but in the end that will not be the decisive reason for the SGP to say: okay, we would do it with that increase and we wouldn\\'t do it with that.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): You\\'re welcome.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I shall now give the floor to Mrs Klip-Martin on behalf of the VVD Group.\\nKlip-Martin, Tanja (VVD): Thank you, Mr President. On behalf of the VVD Group, too, warmly congratulate the Secretary of State on this beautiful position. We look forward to long-term cooperation. Mr. Chairman. Two preliminary remarks. I stand here as an alternate for Mrs De Blécourt. It could be connected to this file in a far derived form. For myself, I worked as a freelancer for the Rembrandt Association in a previous life, but that was 30 years ago. Mr. Chairman. It is now clear what this bill is about. You can see it along two lines. I\\'ll call them short. For centuries, this important work was in private hands. It\\'s been about that for a while. It was owned, among other things, by the King of England. Since 1844, I say in the direction of Mr Janssen, it was in the hands of the De Rothschild family. This purchase will bring this painting into the Dutch public domain and will be visible to everyone. According to specialists, the banner carrier is still in private possession of one of the last highlights. According to those specialists, such a painting does not come again soon. Moreover, it has a great national art history and historical importance. From an art-historical point of view, it marks the breakthrough of the young Rembrandt from Leiden to the already internationally famous Rembrandt from Amsterdam. Historically, the image illustrates the development of Dutch society, with self-conscious citizens, who would arrange their own defenses in Amsterdam, still in the middle of the Eighty Years\\' War, which would only end twelve years later. Private organisations, including the Rembrandt Association, made 25 million available, and from the National Museum Purchase Fund, which has an earmarked budget for art purchases like this, 19 million. A nice public-private partnership, which noted that the Association Rembrandt, which was founded at the end of the nineteenth century precisely to preserve important works of art for the Netherlands, has never made such a big contribution to this goal. Can the Secretary of State indicate how the government looks at the filling of, and spending of, the National Museum Purchase Fund in the future? In other words, drawing on the written answers, can it undertake to further inform the Court of Justice of this after a study report has been published in February? The second line is next. The amount actually requested in this proposal is 131 million. That makes it, still as part of that 150, an extremely high amount. However, according to connoisseurs, the asking price is a real amount and fits into the bizarrely high prices paid for top artworks of this category. The government is not an evaluator of art and culture. So we must also rely on these specialists in terms of pricing. The timing of the purchase is unfortunate, at a time when support packages for the cultural sector heavily affected by corona are needed. It has to be remembered that the French owner brought the work on the market and the Dutch State showed his interest in 2018 before the pandemic corona violence broke out. Mr. Chairman. We all recognize the dilemma between securing this important work of art from a historical and art-historical point of view on the one hand and the considerable sum of money and the unfortunate coronation with the corona measures on the other. However, these are parallel pathways for the members of the VVD Group. Admittedly, you can only spend your money once. We very much agree with Mr Frentrop\\'s quote that public money is always scarce. But it is a one-off expenditure from the general budget and there will therefore be no less money available for the cultural sector. So the choice for the VVD fraction is not either or, but en-en. Fortunately, the cultural sector has already received additional support of 3.2 billion and 84.5 million in December last year. Both times were occasional, but in addition a structural additional contribution of 170 million per year was agreed in the coalition agreement. A debate on thezzp\\'ers in the arts and culture sector would be very good. That debate is probably necessary, but the VVD Group is not a sine qua non to decide on the proposal before us. Mr. Chairman. This purchase may generate additional economic benefits by many additional visitors. There is a chance that De Vaandelbearer will work as a magnet for Rembrandt\\'s already very popular work, but this is not certain. The likely increase in value is not a significant factor in decision-making, because we are never going to sell this painting again. At least, that is a correct assumption, the members of my group ask the Secretary of State. The real question is whether we think a painting of this caliber belongs in the national treasury of the Netherlands. The VVD Group responds positively to this question. Mr President, I will conclude with two more questions to the government. The Vandelbearer is the last major key work of Rembrandt in private possession, unless the Rembrandt Research Project makes spectacular new discoveries. It is also a work of his hand that is a missing link in visualizing and clarifying the development of his artistry. At the same time, this work illustrates the development of Dutch civil society at the time of the Eighty Years\\' War. The government also endorses this historic value of De Vaandelblader, we ask the Secretary of State. Is it realistic to assume that, given the high international auction prices, this work could bring even more to an auction than the current asking price, we ask the government. We are, as always, waiting for the Secretary of State\\'s reaction with great interest.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs. Klip. Then I give the floor to Mr Janssen van de SP for an interruption.\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): Mr President, briefly. I always like to be corrected when I make a mistake somewhere. Mr Klip\\'s sources seem to be talking about 1844. My sources speak of May 8, 1840. Perhaps we could ask the Secretary of State to clarify that.\\nKlip-Martin, Tanja (VVD): I stand corrected, if so. It does not seem to me to matter in that long period of time, but thank you for your up-to-date sharing of information.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs. Klip. I shall then give the floor to Mr Van Kesteren on behalf of the PVV Group.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The PVV Group would like to welcome the new Secretary of State for Culture and Media, Ms Uslu, and good luck in her term of office. The Secretary of State and I probably disagree about the duration of this term of office, but despite that disagreement, I wish her every success. Mr. Chairman. I\\'ll start with a question to the new Secretary of State. Can the Secretary of State indicate why this europhile and globalist government is now proposing to purchase a Dutch painting, a Rembrandt, for as much as 175 million? Is this motivated by patriotism and nationalism, or is this merely an elitist celebration of decadence by paying twice the highest amount ever spent on a Rembrandt painting to a wealthy banking family, with hard-earned taxpayers\\' money? Mr. Chairman. Here is a proposal for an amount in the order of magnitude of the entire art and culture budget, an amount in the order of magnitude for which recently 53 000 Groningen households had to stand behind their computer or queue for a day in vain. I would like to see a response from this Secretary of State. In view of the outcome in the House of Representatives, where the purchase and contribution were voted for, nationalism seems to have won over globalism. Mr. Chairman. This painting also has an enormous cultural and historical value for the PVV group. Aside from the fact that banners ran for the troops during the Eighty Years\\' War, that war also led to the creation of the Netherlands, the country where we should not be proud of ever more eutrophicating Cabinets-Rutte. Our country, which is in danger of losing its sovereignty to a dominant EU, has been made possible by Europhile policies of successive Rutte Cabinets, of which the previous Rutte cabinet in particular was a banner carrier, a banner carrier of wok, which was even against the definition of the Golden Age. A cabinet co-responsible for the prevailing activism in the museum world and the arts and culture sector. A cabinet that allowed Black Piet to be blackened, while Black Piet is already black. A cabinet with scepticism about the hero worship of Michiel de Ruyter, while De Ruyter also fought pirates who traded in slaves. Mr. Chairman. This brings me to my second question to the Secretary of State. Will the Secretary of State for Culture and Media continue the activist-style and wok-obsession I outlined in the previous cabinet? If so, why? If not, what form of government can we expect from this Secretary of State? Mr. Chairman. The Vandelbearer will be hanged in a politically correct Rijksmuseum, where the road is paved for example to ban Michiel de Ruyter and Cornelis Tromp, where the term \"bersiap\" is seen as a racist term, which should therefore not initially be used in the exhibition Revolusi!, about the Indonesian independence struggle between 1945 and 1950, and where the golden carriage is now permanently exhibited, because it can no longer be driven through The Hague in full glory because of an image on the golden carriage for which we should be ashamed. Who guarantees that Rembrandt will not happen to the same thing in the long run, that the next step is that such paintings will no longer be allowed to hang there, given the increasing heat and shame against all achievements during the Golden Age? I would also like a response from this Secretary of State. Besides, isn\\'t our national art heritage broader than Rembrandt alone? There are also lesser-known artists and works of art that deserve our attention and purchase consideration. Known and lesser known painters of ancient Dutch landscapes and scenes, portraits of merchants, rulers and monarchs, of sea battles, of sea heroes and statues most of which, because of the present wokehype, are banned against the West and the whites? And what about contemporary art and artists? Can the new Secretary of State confirm that she does not take the noses for such public art possessions? Can the Secretary of State guarantee that such art linked to slavery and our colonial past, for which we had to be ashamed of the previous cabinet, will be rehabilitated in her term of office? Is there a chance of that? And does this Secretary of State also think that such art is a prominent part of our history, which we should be proud of? Finally, Mr President. Many museums, artists, theatre-maker, actor, musician and technician, many of which have been living around the poverty line for almost two years, could live with a fraction of the astronomical purchase price of De Vaandelblader. With the abolition of the Tozo regime, the Labour Party already called for some attention to be paid to these artists and workers in the arts and culture sector. 170 million on an annual basis for the entire arts and culture sector is not in proportion to the 150 million spent on one painting, De Vaandelbearer. I mentioned Groningen earlier in my speech. That is why this publication is disproportionate for the PVV Group. The PVV Group wonders whether, after 31 January, if the so-called exclusivity clause expires, De Vaandelblader van Rembrandt van Rijn will actually go to another candidate for that amount of EUR 175 million. The French Government has already stated that it is not interested in the purchase of De Vaandelbearer. The question is therefore: can the Secretary of State indicate and estimate whether there are at all multiple candidates for this painting by Rembrandt van Rijn, given the asking price of no less than 175 million euros? If not, could new negotiations not be more beneficial to the Dutch State if it turns out that the number of candidates is disappointing? The spokesman of the Party for Animals had an important point. He said that there is an important condition to it because of the public domain, so that limits all the number of candidates to not further ruin the market for this type of works of art. The course of that period could be beneficial to the negotiating position of the Dutch State, so that the work of art could probably be purchased at a lower amount. That\\'s it, Mr. Chairman.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Van Kesteren. I now give the floor to Mr Pijman, on behalf of the D66 Group.\\nPijlman, Henk (D66): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For my part, too, a warm welcome to the new Secretary of State for Culture and Media. You are opening today the debate series in this temporary accommodation. I would have liked to have been with you in the Knight\\'s Room or in the beautiful old hall of the First Chamber at the Binnenhof, but they are being restored. Now we are debating in a building where fortunately a lot of visual art can be seen, but also in a room where it has completely lacked creative architecture. Fortunately we still have a beautiful piece of art by Navid Nuur. As you have already seen, the President has introduced the fact that there is indeed a great deal of difference of opinion in this Chamber, and that is also evident in the painting. It is good that you start your reign with a substantial increase in the cultural budget, structuralally, for the coming period, so that the cuts in Rutte and Asscher have been undone. I\\'m sure we\\'ll have another debate on how to implement that. Mr. Chairman. The purchase of De Vaandelblader by Rembrandt from 1631 also came at a difficult time according to the cabinet. The cultural sector is still largely closed. Only the educational leg is open again. Culture makers are having a hard time and it is unclear whether many creativezzp\\'ers in particular will survive the corona crisis. Is the support package that you are preparing possible for them now that they are no longer able to use the Tozo scheme? According to research,zzp\\'s in the sector lost between 50% and 70% of their turnover.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): Mr Pijlman asks a question, but I also have a question for him about the people in the cultural sector. Part of my speech was about the time clamp. We have a recovery plan; we will. We need to talk to the sector, and before we have a plan, we\\'ll probably be a while. The need is now high, so I am curious to see whether there would be any reason to make an emergency measure in the short term, a safety net for thezzp\\'ers.\\nPijlman, Henk (D66): I can very well imagine that question. It is therefore also for me to ask the Secretary of State if there are any possibilities for them. The fact that the government comes up with this proposal will have to do with the unique position of the painting in Rembrandt\\'s work and the position it can take in the Netherlands Collection. It will also have to do with the danger that the painting may otherwise disappear, for example in a private collection of an oligarch or an oil prince, who also have museums, which has happened so often in recent years. The general public then has the check. Hopefully that will be avoided now. But how to deal with the public sentiment that the government does have money for a painting, but does the cultural sector not support enough in the pandemic? That image needs nuance, by the way. Contrary to what many believe, the government has greatly helped the cultural sector during the corona crisis. I also think that this should be done more clearly. I believe that I should like to hear a confirmation from the Secretary of State for Agriculture that, so far, 1.5 billion in generic aid has been paid out and 1.7 billion in specific aid. In total, that\\'s 3.2 billion. In addition, creative culture makers were able to make use of general zzp arrangements for coronage strifes and a new arrangement is now being prepared, on which we will be further informed and on which I already asked a question. The question is how, after the pandemic, we can bring new momentum back into the sector. The additional funds of the coalition agreement can be very helpful in this respect. Perhaps the Secretary of State can already reflect on that. Mr. Chairman. In my opinion, the fact that De Vaandelbrugger is Rembrandt\\'s first painting as an independent artist and fits in with the Netherlands Collection makes no difference. It is a unique work that fills a gap in the collection, but it is the second major purchase of the State after the joint purchase by the Netherlands and France of Marten and Oopjen. Is the Rembrandt collection complete or missing pieces that are still important for the Netherlands Collection, I ask the Secretary of State. More generally, we would like to ask who now plays what role and makes proposals for further completion of the Netherlands Collection. Can you clarify the procedures and the decision-making that go with them? Who gave the State advice in this case? How does this generally apply to purchases by the Purchasing Fund and to special items such as the aforementioned? Mr. Chairman. Of course, there is also a discussion about the price the State pays for the painting. Last Saturday, art historian Gary Schwartz in the NRC claimed that 175 million is more than twice the highest amount ever paid for an old master\\'s painting. He had overlooked Marten and Oopjen; 160 million. Two pages later, a Caravaggio is described which is valued at 310 million. Moreover, it clearly shows that the market is in total turmoil, as well as the inequality that exists in it. I don\\'t judge the amount. The painting has been valued. I take it for granted that the State has made every effort to reach the best possible price. The State pays for most of the purchase of the painting. In addition to the OCW budget, which is being increased for this purpose, the amount for the painting is therefore not at the expense of the sector \"s\\', everything is financed by the State from the museum purchase fund, i.e. by the government, but with a different governance structure. It is also a good thing that private money from the Rembrandt Association and from the friends foundation of the Rijksmuseum also private money. But from the museum\\'s purchase fund a big bite, 19 million euros, is taken, which puts other purchases from other museums under pressure. The House of Representatives asked the Minister at the time for a supplement. Can the Secretary of State indicate if the fund has enough room for manoeuvre to keep doing its job? How do you want to deal with this? Mr. Chairman. The painting goes on tour of Dutch museums in the provinces after the purchase. We think that\\'s a nice gesture. We are still informed about the tour and the associated costs, as we understand. Mr. Chairman. The purchase of this painting will enrich the Netherlands Collection with a unique work of art, which will be accessible to everyone. On the legality, efficiency and feasibility of this, and before that we are actually here, after the House of Representatives, there is nothing to be said. D66 therefore wholeheartedly endorses the proposal, but we look forward to the answer to our questions by the Secretary of State.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): In the context of access to art for all, what is Mr Pijlman\\'s view of the need to broaden this? I mean, for example, the golden carriage goes to the Museum of Carriages in Leek. What do you think of that? Should we be able to do that? Shouldn\\'t we be working for that, too?\\nPijlman, Henk (D66): You just said it, too, but that\\'s where he\\'s been. I remember when I was a little boy, I was dragged there with my parents to see the golden carriage. There was no discussion of the panels at the time.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): But shouldn\\'t we be doing it structuralally?\\nPijlman, Henk (D66): I do not feel that this has anything to do with the purchase of De Vaandelbearer, but you might want to make a proposal.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Finally, Mr Van Kesteren.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): There is now so lyrical about De Vaandelblader going on tour of the Netherlands, but shouldn\\'t that happen to national art property anyway? Then the needy museums in the Netherlands also have something to look forward to, I think.\\nPijlman, Henk (D66): I don\\'t understand. Each museum has its own collection. You will undoubtedly also know the programme of the Rijksmuseum in which it lends art to smaller museums. The Hannema House in Harlingen is a very nice example of that, so what you are asking is actually already happening.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you. I call Mr Otten on behalf of the Otten Group.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Mr. Chairman. It takes some getting used to in this new room. I don\\'t know about the others, but I spontaneously got a déjà vu to my chemistry classroom in high school, including the periodic table of elements hanging on the wall with all kinds of colors. But that might be my personal experience. Mr. Chairman. Today we are in this new room all day debating an investment of 150 million in De Vandelbearer van Rembrandt. That is a lot longer than the 40 minutes we debated in this House about the National Growth Fund of EUR 20 billion. That was a small debate which, thanks to our group, was soon to be completed in one term. This is the case in the Netherlands: long talk about smaller investments, but not about megalomaniac billion funds of 20 billion. Mr. Chairman. Our group is not in itself opposed to the purchase of De Vandelbearer by Rembrandt, although we find the price high, as has already been mentioned by a number of other groups. But if you then buy such a painting, and I assume that the negotiations have been done, in particular, by the predecessor of the Secretary of State, so we should not take it personally, then you should do well. We have studied this deal extensively. For those who do not know it yet: my background is mainly in mergers and acquisitions, so it is also professionally something I look at with great interest. Our group has also studied extensively the letter of intent that the Dutch state has concluded with the seller, and this document deserves a clear qualification: it is legal gossip. My first question is therefore: who is the legal adviser of the State who has advised on this journey and has drafted LoI? We would like to hear the answer from the Secretary of State, in particular because it is very important what is in the sale and purchase agreement. For those who do not know: you close a letter or intent and then we all have to approve it and then there will be a sale and purchase agreement, a SPA, which will be signed as soon as possible after we have voted. We would like to see this SPA before we vote, because the LoI does not offer us that much confidence. Greater preparedness is therefore needed for the State, because the negotiation process so far does not give us very much comfort. Why not? If you buy such a painting for 175 million, of which 150 million tax dollars, you have to be sure that you really buy the right painting. Was there any good research on the title of the painting? I tried to look into that myself yesterday. I also came to 1848. There was also someone who sold it in 1797, I believe, for 1,200 francs. He had to sell it at a loss in 1801. After all, it ended up with the Rothschild family through Christie\\'s. Mr Janssen had already done some research on it, I saw, so I was just exchanging some experiences. But you should know very well that you buy the right painting and also that you do business with the right family person and the right representative of the family, who also owns the painting. It\\'s quite an extensive family, with different stakes and branches. Do we know that? And should it cause problems in the family, which is not unimaginable at all, is there a course of the Dutch State to dissolve the deal and get the money back? I see in that LoI a very moderate due diligence clause. The result of the due diligence is really not important for the deal. The guarantees are really insufficient for a deal of this magnitude. The Rothschild family says: \"to the best of our knowledge\" it is a real Rembrandt. I think you should ask for more guarantees for that amount. That deal says about: it\\'s \"to the best of know,\" \"I don\\'t know any better\" and \"it was always on the wall so it must be a real one.\" For such a deal, so even after the reps and wars and thus the guarantees of the deal, that is really not enough. That is why we also want to see this sale and purchase agreement, because we do not think that the best knowledge qualification is acceptable.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Mr Schalk of the SGP is interrupting.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): I believe that Mr Otten is right to ask questions, particularly about the negotiation process. Only, he asked very explicitly: who did these negotiations? I suppose he\\'s not asking about a person\\'s name, but about an organization or anything like that.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Yes.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): \\'Cause the only name we have to name in this house today is Rembrandt, I think. If we\\'re gonna discuss people, I think we\\'re lost.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): I\\'d like to know which legal advisor the State used. Is that, like, the state\\'s attorney? Because as an expert in this field, I can say that about myself. I found the LoI rather clumsy. So I would like to know who is doing that and whether or not someone else with even more knowledge should take a look at it. Because this did not make me feel very good, I say to Mr Schalk.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): Thank you for the answer. In any case, it is clear that, according to the mores of this house, we are not going to talk about people who have done such a thing. Then we\\'ve got that sharp.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): That\\'s right. I agree with that.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Mr Schalk sees things that are not there, I think. I\\'ll be right back, Mr. Chairman. There was another aspect we noticed about this purchase agreement. It has often been discussed here in this Chamber, recently when the Tax Plan was being discussed, it is very much in favour of preventing tax avoidance. So we went deeper into the whole transaction and we came to the conclusion that the Dutch State buys this painting by Rembrandt from a trust based on the Cook Islands, in the middle of the Pacific, whose holding company is located in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a tax haven between Martinique and Barbados in the Caribbean Sea, for those who do not know where it is. I\\'ll save it all for you, but for those who love it, this document contains the entire fiscal structure of the seller of the painting. The reason we all know this is that all of this has been revealed in the so-called Panama Papers and can all be sorted out publicly. How does this transaction relate to the Dutch government\\'s policy to prevent tax avoidance, is our question to the Secretary of State. Mkb\\'ers andzzp\\'ers who are a day late with their VAT return will immediately receive a heavy fine. Why does the State cooperate in such constructions? We would like to hear the answer from the Secretary of State and ask her to open the transaction with the seller and renegotiate this agreement with proper guarantees, and we are also sure that we buy this painting from the right person and that the painting is also verified and we know that it is the real Rembrandt. Then perhaps at the same time something can be done about the very high price of this painting, because so many buyers are not there for De Vaandelbearer. This has already been mentioned by other speakers. We look forward to the answer of the Secretary of State.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Otten. Then I give the floor to Mr Atsma, who will speak on behalf of the CDA.\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): Mr President, thank you. The CDA Group also congratulates the Secretary of State and wishes her every success. Looking at my own experience, I\\'d say, \"Good luck.\"\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I\\'m gonna take care of it anyway. Firstly, it is not intended to show objects in advance without consultation. Why not? Because we are legally obliged to ensure that people at home are able to follow the debate properly. That\\'s what the law prescribes. People at home can\\'t always follow complicated things when we show objects. Secondly, we cannot provide information outside the Chamber to the government, so I would ask that the paper that Mr Otten had just delivered to the Secretary of State be removed from there. If we are to provide information, it must be made public and all Members of Parliament must know what is being exchanged with the government. This should also be mentioned in public and should be visible to people at home. So that information goes back to Mr Otten. I would therefore ask you to consult with us in advance when displaying objects. Mr. Atsma, proceed.\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): Mr President, thank you. A lot has already been said. That\\'s right, it\\'s a lot of money. That raises many questions, especially in the cultural sector, we have all been able to read and hear from different sides. We have also seen the answers of the Secretary of State to questions in this direction. The Secretary of State, as Mr Pijlman has explained in detail, said that it is not so much at the expense of the budget available for culture as it is additional resources which are added to the budget and which come from the general budget. Nevertheless, it remains, of course, a great deal of money, which must also be properly accounted for. Many questions have also been asked about the procurement procedure, in the last hour and a half. The CDA Group could add a number of questions, in particular about what has been said about the valuation. The Secretary of State writes in our direction that there was one valuer who considered in 2018 whether the work is actually worth buying. In this sense, we also question whether this is the right procedure in the future. Shouldn\\'t it be assessed on the basis of a broader orientation? I am also looking at the spokesperson of the Labour Party who seems to have gained the necessary experience with appraisals. In this case, more valuations could very well be possible in the case of an investment of this magnitude. In the way in which the amount currently earmarked for the purchase of De Vaandeldrager is financed, it is striking that only a relatively limited amount comes from private funds. In this sense, you could ask whether funds could be made available through crowdfunding, for example, or something similar. Can we at least start a search for additional resources? In this context, I refer to the Rembrandt project, which will start again next week via NPO 1; I believe that the NTR is broadcasting it. Last year and the year before, between one and one and a half million people watched this programme on average. That of course also says something about the popularity, not so much about the person Rembrandt, but about the phenomenon. I can imagine that it will be looked at in consultation with NPO. We are not talking about the content of programmes, but it certainly seems worthwhile to me to ask that question. After all, in other cases where money is to be raised, we sometimes do so through public or private media. Mr. Chairman. When purchasing this painting, the CDA group has no judgment as to whether this painting is worth the money. We are happy to leave that to experts on the matter. What is relevant, however, is the question of how much more cultural heritage will be available at some point and perhaps also in the hands of the Dutch State, at least the public in the Netherlands. The question then arises as to whether there is an adequate inventory available. What works will be available now and in the near future in which the Netherlands, looking at its cultural and historical heritage, could have an interest? I can imagine that it will be considered whether there is some sort of index, list or inventory to be made of such works. You could then do this together with the museums in the Netherlands, so that you are also, as is now suggested, away from the phenomenon that it is much like ad hoc policy.\\nPijlman, Henk (D66): I understand what Mr Atsma is saying. It has already been said by others that there should be such a list. Aren\\'t you terrified that if there were such a public list, this would drive up prices?\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): I don\\'t think so, because it\\'s always about the valuation: what is the real value of a painting or artwork in general? This has also been put forward by you in your own contribution. But it\\'s also about the terms on which you buy and what you want. I repeat what you yourself said. What is still feasible, also looking at the resources available to the Dutch State? Maybe you should prioritize. There\\'s nothing wrong with making an overview on which you indicate what you would and wouldn\\'t want to buy if it came on the market at any time. This is also done in other gremia, so I can imagine that this is done, especially when it comes to the masterpieces of Dutch history. We must at least get rid of the suggestion that it is now a little ad hoc, because no one has any interest in that. I think it is absolutely essential that you think about this, together with the museums in the Netherlands.\\nPijlman, Henk (D66): I can imagine a lot of what you\\'re saying. It can\\'t be too ad hoc. I can also imagine very well I have also asked for such a procurement procedure to be completely transparent, including from the purchase fund. At the same time, I should like to warn that if there is such a list, it will also increase the price in the valuations. So you have to come up with a procedure that meets what you\\'re saying, but making it completely public doesn\\'t seem very convenient for the purchasing party, in this case the State.\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): Then, with all due respect, you should also ask the question whether you, as the Netherlands, still want to express your interest in Rembrandt\\'s works, because in all corners of the world people know that if a Rembrandt comes on the market, there could be interest from the Netherlands. Of course, this also applies to other masters, such as Vermeer, Van Gogh and mention that we could quote in this context.\\nFrentrop, Paul (FvD): I am very pleased that Mr Atsma is also proposing to draw up a sort of list of potential national art possessions, as I have proposed in my contribution. I share his opinion that this should not be price-driven at all, because the art world knows whether the Rijksmuseum or the Dutch State is interested in a work. Mr Atsma said that the museums should draw up such a list. I would suggest that this should be extended. Can we not somehow give the broad Dutch population a form of participation in this, in order to strengthen the basis for artistic procurement policy?\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): Of course, that sounds very sympathetic. I could easily say yes. However, I would like to put this question to the Secretary of State through the President, so that in the coming period she herself can breed on what could be a viable path, which does justice to the quality and uniqueness of the work of art, but also to that which can be extremely relevant to society. You can then consider a number of criteria. I am not going to answer that question, but I do think that the Secretary of State could discuss this question with her experts. I am happy to put that question to the Secretary of State through the President.\\nFrentrop, Paul (FvD): I\\'d like to join that. I ask the Secretary of State, together with Mr Atsma, to think about this.\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): I repeat once again that we have no judgment on the value of a work of art by Rembrandt, as it now comes to us through De Vaandelbearer. Mr Van Kesteren made a rather strange comparison with Groningen in my view. I say in his direction that at least the CDA group has taken note of the view of the well-known Groninger artist Henk Helmandel. In the Dagblad van het Noorden of December last year he said: I choose to say yes to the purchase of this painting. Let that at least be an argument that we still want to use. Mr. Chairman. Finally, the final point. The Secretary of State has indicated that the painting De Vaandelblader should be shown to the Dutch people via a tour through the Netherlands. We very much agree with that. We made the same suggestion at the time when we bought Marten and Oopjen. I can very well imagine that this journey begins or ends in the Netherlands at the Fries Museum in Leeuwarden, because of the relationship Rembrandt had with that city. I would like to endorse what others have said. There\\'s another question. If you talk with great words about a tour of the Netherlands, are there museums available in all provinces that have sufficient opportunities to exhibit these kinds of works? That sounds like a challenge to me. Thank you.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): Mr Atsma challenged me. That calls for a response. The victims of the gas extraction in Groningen read that 175 million will be available for one painting. This while they have to go out with thousands of people to beg the government to qualify for that, I believe, 200 million. And then it turns out they\\'re still fishing behind the net after all. Can Mr Atsma then imagine that the affected inhabitants of Groningen also find this disproportionate?\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): I can imagine that very well. This applies, however, to any substantial expenditure the Empire makes. Of course, there are many more examples of tens of millions, hundreds of millions, perhaps billions that are currently at the expense of the Empire. I can imagine Groninger\\'s question very well. I also followed the march by Groningen last Saturday. I am pleased that the new Secretary of State who is dealing with gas extraction and the problem that is attached to it has visited Groningen this week. He has made it clear that the Empire is willing to raise extra money.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): I would also like to ask Mr Atsma if he can imagine that, as a Member of the House of Representatives in the Chambre de réflexion, you can sell social spending against such an edition for one painting. You have to realize that this can lead to unrest and dissatisfaction in society.\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): I\\'ve already told you how I feel about that. I can imagine that many people have these thoughts, but I say again that the rich budget is about many, many billions, of which in some cases the question can also be asked as to whether it is necessary. That is a political assessment, but I do not think the comparison is valid in this case.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): I can understand Mr Van Kesteren, because the people in Groningen have to jump through all kinds of bureaucratic hoops and stand in line for hours in the cold. They have to fill out all kinds of forms and everything has to fit picobello. We saw the same thing with the surcharges. Now we see this 175 million. As I said before, we are not necessarily against buying this painting, but do it right. This is where it gets a little half-half-assed. How does Mr Atsma look at the fact that these Groningers and the people who pay allowances have to fill out all the forms and that everything has to be picobello, all of which takes a very long time and cannot be solved, while this is being handled quite easily and not as precisely as those victims do. How do you see that?\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): I said what I said about buying this painting. I am quite clear about the handling of the damage in Groningen: this has to be resolved. I agree with Mr Agnes Mulder on the other side, who has used similar words. I think it needs to be picked up and solved. Groningen must be done justice. There can be no discussion about that. But that\\'s different than weighing one thing against another. No, Groningen is a separate subject. That needs to be arranged as soon as possible. And I am pleased that this week the Secretary of State paid a visit to the Groningen Government to clarify the government\\'s commitment to this issue.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Finally, Mr Otten.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): That\\'s not my point. My question was: how can it be that the government of the Groningen and of the people of the supplementing affair requires enormous legal care and keeps those people waiting for a very long time, while this care in the purchase of this painting is apparently less important? Then we\\'ll have a double standard, won\\'t we? You should take care of it in such an important transaction. In our opinion, this has not entirely happened, apart from the fiscal aspects. How do you see that?\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): In particular, Mr Otten has highlighted a number of legal aspects. I\\'m curious to hear the answers to his questions. I said that we have no opinion on the purchase price. We have only found that only one valuation from 2018 is the basis of the purchase amount that is now on the table. We think that\\'s skinny. That is why we asked the Secretary of State if she would look at this procedure for future purchases. That\\'s what I said, Mr. Chairman.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you. Does one of the Members still wish to speak in the first term? Mrs Nanninga, I would like to talk to you first, because you had not requested speaking time. I call Mrs Nanninga.\\nNanninga, Annabel (vanPareren): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this coulance. I did not ask for any speaking time, but having heard all this, I would like to take the floor briefly. Well, you can, considering the agenda time until 4:20 p.m. I\\'m going to be very brief not to let the agenda run out. Think of it as an explanation of vote, if you like, saves some time at the end of this journey. JA21 supports the purchase of this Rembrandt. Our party is in favour of acquiring, preserving and making accessible our cultural heritage. Especially if that is a work by Rembrandt van Rijn, the greatest of the greats and if we have the chance to bring De Vaandelblader home to the Netherlands. The comparison that almost all of the speakers made for me in this debate, namely between Rembrandt, an artistic icon of our glorious Golden Age and the artists of today, who are absolutely desperate, is limp. We haven\\'t been able to detect Rembrandt among the latter. If there were, he or she would not need support, as Rembrandt in his heyday. JA21 welcomes this acquisition. We do, however, have the request to the Secretary of State, whom we wish success and congratulate on her appointment. The request is: can this canvas not be hung behind the speaker\\'s seat in the Lower House, rather than the hideous mud cliffs that are now hanging, as exponent of our contemporary art world? Thank you.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs Nanninga. I would ask Members, where possible, to honour the agreement that we should request speaking time on Wednesday before the debate at 12 noon. Time is good now, but we sometimes run out of time. The planning with one additional speaker often means 45 minutes or an hour extra on a day. We all accommodate that, but the demand towards the employees is really to keep the appointment to turn it in on Wednesday at 12 noon, where possible.\\nThe next item is the continuation of the debate on the legislative proposal 35984, Incidental supplementary budget on the acquisition of artwork. We need the government\\'s first-term response. I give the floor to the Secretary of State for Culture and Media.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Mr President, thank you for your invitation to speak with you from my new role as Secretary of State for Culture and Media. This is my first debate in Parliament. It\\'s special for me to be the first to have this with you, here in the First Chamber. I look forward to talking to you about the importance of culture and the media and their commitment in the coming period. Today we talk about the effort to acquire the painting De Vaandelbearer by Rembrandt for the Netherlands. First of all, I would like to address the more general questions about the background to the proposal and the process surrounding the purchase. Then I will answer your more specific questions on the basis of a few themes. Let me start with the observation that the Netherlands Collection is a rich, dynamic collection. That collection is never finished. Museums regularly take the initiative to acquire special works and thus enrich the public collection. They are also supported by public and private resources. This complex process started in close cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and the Rijksmuseum. This resulted in a declaration of intent to buy and the proposal that my predecessor sent to Parliament. The cabinet proposes, subject to parliamentary approval, to release 150 million for the purchase of this painting. To this end, an incidental supplementary budget is in your Chamber today. This proposal was accepted by the House of Representatives on 16 December. I would like to emphasise that there has been a lot of work recently on a proposal for a purchase to submit to Parliament. I note that the purchase has not yet been closed. That requires your Chamber\\'s approval. That is why I am here today to answer your questions and discuss any concerns you may have. I understand that this purchase, in the middle of a pandemic, raises questions as well. The cultural sector has been severely affected by the corona measures. The previous cabinet has therefore made more than 1.8 billion available for specific support to our cultural sector. This is in addition to the use of generic measures by the sector. Since the start of the corona crisis, more than 3.3 billion has been devoted to the cultural sector. At this time of corona measures, the cultural and creative sector demonstrated its enormous innovative capacity and at the same time its vulnerability. Therefore, in line with the principles of the coalition agreement, I am committed to restoring and strengthening the cultural and creative sector at this difficult time. Culture is essential for our society, now and also for the future. It\\'s an investment in our society. The connecting, inspiring and stimulating power of art and culture brings people together, challenges and offers perspectives. Why now our ambition to buy this Rembrandt? If we want to add this work to the Netherlands Collection, now is the time. The seller\\'s putting it on the market now. The acquisition is now possible. That\\'s a possibility that\\'s not gonna happen again anytime soon. I realize how uncomfortable this feels at a time when the cultural and creative sectors are sighing under the consequences of the pandemic. Rembrandt belongs to a select group of international top artists. The banner carrier is a key work. The quality of the work lies in a combination of the subject, the unique style of the maker and its importance for the Netherlands Collection. The banner carrier reflects Rembrandt\\'s artistic development on the way to De Nachtwacht. The painting is the missing link in Rembrandt\\'s oeuvre in the Netherlands. It is a remarkably well preserved painting and marks a turning point in his career. It comes from his baroque phase and from that period there are no other works by Rembrandt in the Netherlands. Already during Rembrandt\\'s life, De Vaandelbearer inspired other artists to make copies and new interpretations. That happened in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but also today. See, for example, the artist Anne Ermens, who was just quoted by Mrs Fiers of the PvdA. Rembrandt inspires many artists, and I like to give it to the Rijksmuseum to do something beautiful with it. A good example was their exhibition in 2019: Long live Rembrandt. From over 8,000 entries by artists and amateur artists, a jury chose 700 works, which were exhibited in the Rijksmuseum. The quality of De Vaandelbrugger also translates into the high price. I\\'m aware of that. Such top works are internationally loved and sought. The international art market is also erratic. The price for this work was achieved in contact with the seller and assessed by experts. The amount of the prize means that I would like to present this proposal to your Chamber, with the conviction that we could add an international top work to the Netherlands Collection and thus make it accessible to current and future generations. When the acquisition is complete, De Vaandeldrager will be maximum visible and make a tour of various museums in all provinces of the Netherlands. Through educational programs, the Rijksmuseum will embed this painting in the story about the Netherlands. My predecessor has promised the House of Representatives to share the plan for this and, of course, I will inform you about it. The cultural importance of this work is great. At the same time, I do not lose sight of the importance of contemporary art, young makers and its support. I consider the acquisition of this old master in the context of all other valuable purchases made by museums. This is made possible thanks to public funds and private funding, such as the Association Rembrandt, the BankGiro Lottery and the many Friend Foundations. The Mondriaan Fund, as mentioned earlier, contributed to an impressive work by African artist El Anatsui, entitled In the world, but don\\'t know the world. That was for the Stedelijk Museum and the Art Museum Bern. Last week, the Van Gogh Museum acquired four rare prints by American artist Mary Cassatt, thanks to a contribution from among others the Mondriaan Fund and the Rembrandt Association. Finally, I refer to the purchase of a work by the outsider artist Willem van Genk for the Dolhuys in Haarlem. This is just a selection of the special purchases that are equally an enrichment of the Netherlands Collection. If the purchase succeeds, a top work will be added to the Netherlands Collection. It will be visible to everyone at home and abroad, starting with a tour of all provinces in the Netherlands. My ambition is to strengthen the Netherlands Collection with works by both well-known and lesser-known artists. I think it is important to continue to add new perspectives to the Netherlands Collection. Finally, I am also pleased that the coalition agreement has agreed to invest 660 million in the creative and cultural sector in the current cabinet period. This is to make recovery, renewal and growth possible again. The position of the creators is at the top of the agenda. Mr. Chairman. If you will allow me, I will now answer the specific questions along a few themes. These themes are: the painting and the tour, the purchasing process, cultural sector, positionzzp\\'ers, corona measures and individual questions. I start with the painting and his journey through the Netherlands. Mr. Pijlman of D66 asked whether the Rembrandt collection is now complete or whether there are still pieces missing that are important for the Netherlands Collection. The cabinet considers the Netherlands Collection as a dynamic collection that is never finished. But it does not have a list of works of art of national interest which are privately owned, neither by Rembrandt nor by any other artist who is already thought to be acquired. As a rule, museums in the Netherlands themselves take the initiative on the basis of their own collection policy when the opportunity arises to strengthen the public collection. They are regularly supported by both public and private resources. Mrs Klip van de VVD asked: is it true that the increase in value is not important, because we assume that the painting will never come on the market again? That\\'s right. After acquisition, De Vaandelbearer will be part of the national collection. This means that the public is held and withdrawn from the market. Mr. Chairman. Mrs Klip also asked: is it real to assume that the proceeds at auction would have been higher? The Vandelbearer is a top work in the oeuvre of one of the most important artists of all time. Such top works are very popular internationally and are sought by collectors all over the world. Rembrandt\\'s wedding portraits by Marten and Oopjen were acquired in 2016 for 160 million, which has already been mentioned here. The quality of De Vandelbrugger is exceptional, both artistically and in terms of the state in which the canvas is located. Moreover, it marks Rembrandt\\'s artistic breakthrough. Like Vermeer, Van Gogh, Da Vinci and Picasso, Rembrandt is out of category. Artworks from this sub-category are extremely expensive. The painting The Card Players of French Impressionist Paul Cézanne was sold in 2011 for 259 million dollars. Leonardo\\'s Salvator Mundi was sold for $450 million in 2017. The international art dealership is erratic and the prices for the most important unique artworks are difficult to compare, but the examples mentioned show that the art market has price upward effects. This is, by the way, the same as with other markets. Therefore, it is very conceivable that those interested in an auction would offer more than 175 million.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Mrs. Prast of D66... from the Party for Animals.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): It is the first meeting in this Chamber, so let\\'s go. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Secretary of State repeats what she wrote in response to questions from the OCW Committee. I have asked critical questions about this. I expect an answer to that later. She also repeats the Salvator Mundi. I had already referred to this in my plenary contribution. Is the Secretary of State aware that the Louvre refused to hang that painting at an exhibition, because it is probably not Da Vinci\\'s, but a student\\'s? Is that a good example to compare this purchase with?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): The question was about the art dealership. It\\'s erratic in terms of prices and how it plays. Those prices aren\\'t very accurate. Those prices have been quoted for that. It wasn\\'t about the originality of the paintings.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): I\\'m gonna lose track anyway. A painting for which the highest price has ever been paid on the market is quoted here to persuade us to vote for the purchase. But we might know, you only have to look it up for a moment. President Macron has refused the request of the owner, the Saudi Crown Prince, to exhibit it in the Louvre. He thought, \"That\\'s gonna be a way to launder it.\" I don\\'t mean that financially. In this way, France would give a stamp of approval that it is Da Vinci\\'s. That\\'s a very strange example, isn\\'t it? I won\\'t say comparison. It is almost presented as a basis for these prices and for the fact that the price at an auction would be higher. I have already indicated: if it has to be in the public domain, I would like to hear why it would have an even higher price at the auction. I ask how the Secretary of State now considers this example appropriate in the context of the purchase.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Thank you for your question. Let me first thank you for the question. I have put forward these examples to show what prices are, how the art market moves and what comparable prices are. I didn\\'t look at the originality. I didn\\'t look at the status and the average ideas... I didn\\'t bring those discussions up.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Finally, Mrs Prast.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): I wouldn\\'t call this a discussion, but actually a sign that you might not have to refer to that market to convince us. But I\\'ll leave it at that.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): You continue your speech, Secretary of State.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Mrs Klip asked if I agree that the painting has a historical value as well as its cultural historical value. Yeah, I agree. It also has historical value. Rembrandt was 30 years old when he painted De Vaandelbearer and had just started for himself. With this painting he wanted to show what he could do as an accomplished painter. At the same time, with this work of art, he showed the ambition to paint a group portrait for the city guards of Amsterdam. He succeeded six years later when he received the assignment to paint De Nachtwacht. The subject of his painting is the banner bearer. It is also historically interesting in the context of the fences in the seventeenth century. The vigilantes had an essential role in the Eighty Years\\' War, the rebellion against Spanish authority which resulted in the birth of an independent Netherlands in 1648. This painting indeed has a historical value for the Netherlands. Mr. Chairman. Mr Schalk of the SGP asked about the future value of the painting. The painting will be part of the national collection after acquisition. This collection does not represent any financial value after acquisition and is not on the financial balance sheet of the Empire. The painting is acquired because of its exceptional cultural historical value. The purchase of this work is not intended as an investment which could be made at a later date. The rules of the Erfgoedwet and the Guide to Rejecting Museum Objects of the museum sector apply to the rejection of works from the national collection. Rejecting this painting for a financial purpose does not fit in with the careful handling of cultural goods. I\\'ve also thought about a theoretical situation, because we\\'re not going to reject it, but let\\'s say. The art market is hard to predict. I was just talking about it. If we take into account current developments, it may well be that the work is increasing in value, but as a State we do not intend to sell it. Mr Frentrop of Forum voor Democracy asked if the Netherlands is ready for De Vaandelblader. The way we look at art, of course, is not a given. The assessment of art always takes place within the social context of the moment. Rembrandt is always very much appreciated internationally. The morality of the person Rembrandt or his oeuvre is in my knowledge not part of a broad social discussion. Rembrandt is part of our common history. Of course there are different perspectives on this, but I do not have the idea that Rembrandt is currently part of that social discussion.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): I\\'ve already asked, but this seems like a good time to ask. I think I agree with the Secretary of State that Rembrandt is not a person under discussion. Of course, that can always happen. But I indicated that the painting has a Javanese criss. Rembrandt painted this somewhere in the late 1920s, early 1930s of the seventeenth century. In 1619 the VOC destroyed Jayakarta. That criss, yeah. Rembrandt wouldn\\'t have found it online on a picture. I couldn\\'t. He must have really had a criss in the house. Did the Secretary of State investigate how that kris got there?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): No, I didn\\'t examine that. As you know, I\\'ve only been Secretary of State for a week. I didn\\'t have room to figure that out. I can go and see if my predecessor has done so. I can come back to that later, if I may.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): Before the Secretary of State took office as Secretary of State, she was an advisor to the Rembrandt Association. So I think she needs to know a thing or two about Rembrandt and his work. That criss is a very big thing on that picture. Didn\\'t this come up at the Rembrandt Association?\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): The Secretary of State is no longer here on behalf of the Rembrandt Association, but on behalf of the Cabinet and can only speak on behalf of the Cabinet, as you know, Mrs Prast. Secretary of State, the floor is yours.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): For the answer or the question? I can\\'t remember.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): I went into the fact that the Secretary of State said, \"I\\'m just on board, so I can\\'t know. Then I referred to one of the co-buyers of the painting, namely the Vereniging Rembrandt, but I do not expect an answer to my question.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you. Please continue your speech, Secretary of State.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Mrs Veldhoen of the GroenLinks group asked: \"Does the Netherlands need a Rembrandt? Shouldn\\'t the look be widened? Do we have too limited a look at our historical canon?\" The banner carrier is a special work by Rembrandt. Museums have their own responsibility to take the initiative for the purchase of works of art on the basis of their collection plans. I consider the purchase of De Vandelbearer in a broader perspective. I also have an eye for other special purchases that museums have recently acquired for the Netherlands Collection. I have already mentioned some examples of this. Besides, I have an eye for today\\'s makers. Mrs Veldhoen also asked how I can guarantee the maximum accessibility that my predecessor has promised. When the acquisition is complete, De Vaandeldrager will be maximum visible and make a tour of various museums in all provinces in the Netherlands. Through educational programs, the Rijksmuseum will embed this painting in the story about the Netherlands. My predecessor has promised the House of Representatives to share the plan for this. Of course, I\\'ll inform you about this too.\\nVeldhoen, Gala (GL): Thank you to the Secretary of State for answering my question about today\\'s makers. I am very glad that the Secretary of State says: I have an eye for the makers of today. I would like to hear more about that. In what way does the Secretary of State intend to take into account policy that today\\'s makers are also being addressed, just as we are now spending a very large amount of money on the creators of the past?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Again, I\\'ve only been Secretary of State for a week. I don\\'t have any concrete plans yet. I want to make it for the next few days. My ambition to stand here has to do with me wanting to really be meaningful and be committed to young makers, to self-employed people. But at the moment I do not have any concrete plans that I can present. Can I come back to that later?\\nVeldhoen, Gala (GL): Of course, all the understanding that you don\\'t have those plans yet, because you\\'ve only been in office for a week. But indeed, I would very much like to hear your undertaking that you will formulate these plans, because that is how I understand what you are saying here: that you will come up with a formulation of these plans and that you will also share them with the Chamber. Am I getting that right?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): You understand that very well.\\nVeldhoen, Gala (GL): With that commitment: thank you for that.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Mrs Fiers on behalf of the Labour Party.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): I thought there was gonna be another block ofzzp\\'ers. Otherwise, I\\'ll get back to you in a minute.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): We\\'re only on theme one and we\\'ve got five. I\\'m gonna treat it all. It\\'s a lot of questions. We\\'ve classified them thematically. I\\'m only at the first part now, which is about the painting itself and the tour. I would like to repeat this: I will go into the purchasing process in more detail, and I will deal with the cultural sector, thezzp\\'ers and the corona measures.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I would say: continue your speech.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Mr Schalk of the SGP asked: how will the Secretary of State ensure broad public availability, other than the Honour Gallery of the Rijksmuseum? The intention is to allow the painting to go on tour through the Netherlands after acquisition, through museums in all parts of the country. The condition is that the safety and other conditions that can be expected for such a loan can be met and that the work is in good condition for travel. A plan for this is currently being drawn up by the Rijksmuseum, in consultation with the Ministry. You will also be informed about this plan. Mr Van Kesteren of the PVV asked: why this painting for 150 million? Again, everyone has asked for more, but they will. This painting is the missing link in Rembrandt\\'s oeuvre in the Netherlands, where Rembrandt distinguishes himself for the first time as a rebel and self-righteous artist. That marks his artistic breakthrough, which would lead to the Night\\'s Watch. The Netherlands is the country of Rembrandt. De Vaandeldrager marks the birth of the Netherlands and is therefore inextricably linked to the history of the Netherlands. We should like to preserve this kind of key piece for the Netherlands. The purchase will bring the painting into the public domain and will also be permanently visible for future generations to the general public, from home and abroad. The remarkably well-preserved painting of a standing man in a proud pose marks a tilting point in his oeuvre in the oppaat to De Nachtwacht. It is also inextricably linked to the history of the Netherlands. At the Rijksmuseum, where the largest and most representative collection of Rembrandt paintings is housed in the world, there is so far no such ambitious work by Rembrandt.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): I\\'ll be back on the tour. I understand very well that the painting will go to all the provinces in no time. Then it will be very accessible especially to young people and so on, but older people, this was also one of my questions about this: €20 will have to be paid to enter the Rijksmuseum. That while we\\'re all paying for this painting. Does that plan also include any reduction in amounts or the like at the time when the painting is on tour, so that it is actually going to have its function?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): The plans haven\\'t been made yet. They\\'re being drafted, but I haven\\'t seen them yet. However, I can take that suggestion and recommend that it be taken when the plans are made.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): May I see it as a commitment that you say: \\'Okay, that will be the government\\'s commitment to ensure that everyone has access as easily as possible and therefore does not have to pay extra because we are all going to pay for it\\'. After all, the 175 million we all bring in?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): As far as the substantive plan is concerned, I cannot actually commit anything at the moment, because I have not yet seen the plan. It\\'s in the making and we\\'re gonna see. However, I can inform you of this in writing or orally.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Perhaps you can promise the effort.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I can promise the effort anyway.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): Mr. President, you\\'re always great at helping.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you. Then Mr Van Kesteren on behalf of the PVV.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): The Secretary of State has just made a wonderful speech about the Golden Age and the art that has produced it. I would like to ask the Secretary of State whether this will also deal with the wok culture, which is still common in the Golden Age at the moment. Do you say, \"No, we should be proud of that period and of the art that produced it. Certainly that wok idea is not depreciating to me as far as everything that the Golden Age has produced is concerned. We should be really proud of that.\"? Do you think that or do you say \\'no, I would like to make a comment\\', as your predecessor always did?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Mr. Chairman. I think it\\'s a difficult question now. If there\\'s social discussions, they\\'re there. They are also part of our history and our society. There must be room for these different perspectives. But be proud and happy with a Rembrandt and our history: those feelings are there. But as far as the openness of society and the different ideas about art and culture are concerned, we must of course be open to that.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): I have a final question, Mr. Chairman. But as far as you\\'re concerned, that shouldn\\'t affect our thoughts about and appreciation of art? That\\'s a discussion, but that shouldn\\'t affect the art that the Golden Age has produced, as far as you\\'re concerned?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I think we can all be extremely proud of and happy with what we have produced and produced here in the Netherlands in terms of art and culture. There will also be critical noises, and that is allowed. But it\\'s our history. It\\'s our society. I call that openness and that we can have both proud feelings and be critical. I think I can close with that.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you. You will continue your speech. Oh, Mrs Fiers on behalf of the Labour Party. Perhaps it would be an idea if we stopped the interruptions after you until the end of each subject, otherwise the Secretary of State could not make any progress in her speech. May I introduce that to the Members? Go ahead, Mrs. Fiers.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): I try to shoot into the boxes, but sometimes it\\'s a little hard to know if we\\'ve had it all. I\\'ll be back on the tour anyway. This debate is, of course, also a bit to get to know the new Secretary of State, so I ask a little bit from time to time. I understand that you can say, \"I don\\'t know the plan yet.\" But of course we are also curious about how you are in it. Your predecessor made a commitment following the motion of the SP in the Lower House to go for maximum accessibility. I can\\'t wait to see how you see that. You haven\\'t seen a plan yet, but I\\'m looking forward to your opinion on that. Then I also said something about the tour. We mentioned Leeuwarden. I\\'d like to get a comment from you on that.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I didn\\'t hear the last sentence very well, because Mrs. Fiers just walked away. Could I hear the last sentence one more time?\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): The tour went especially to Leeuwarden because of his lover. It might be nice for you to respond to that.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): You can do that briefly, Secretary of State.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): It seems very nice to me when De Vaandelbearer goes to Leeuwarden and people can see that and enjoy such a beautiful work of art. I\\'ll get to visibility and accessibility in a minute, if you don\\'t mind. If it is not enough, Mrs Fiers can ask the question again.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Then I suggest you report it when you\\'re at the end of the block, painting and tour. Let\\'s see what the interruptions are. Is that okay with you? Go ahead.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Mrs Fiers asked: what does the Secretary of State think of the criticism that we are suffering from the major name disease and how can the Secretary of State ensure that top works from Collection Netherlands are better spread across the country and give a pluralistic picture of art history? I consider De Vaandelbearer van Rembrandt to be a very special painting and I see this purchase in a broader perspective. Of course, I also have an eye for works of art by lesser-known artists, young artists, young talents. I consider visibility and accessibility of collections to be of paramount importance to the public. This special painting will go on tour in the Netherlands. I know that there is a lively loan traffic between museums. They will coordinate where which work is going. I do not know whether I have answered Mrs Fiers\\' question as far as accessibility is concerned. The Vandelbearer will travel and there will also be an educational program attached to it. This makes De Vaandeldrager visible and accessible to a wider audience, also for young people and young artists. It becomes part of a package. This is included in a package and in the education plan. Then there was a question from Mrs Prast of the Party for Animals. She asked about the Javanese criss carrying The Vandelbearer. Mrs Prast spoke about the picture of the criss and about the unrest about it, and she asked why this was not shared. I think it is important that more and more attention is paid to the traces of the colonial past and how we deal with it. The origin of the painting was of course important in the assessment; now I get the answers on this issue as well. The presence of this object on the painting was important in the assessment, but it was not seen as an obstacle to its purchase. Of course it is also important that the painting is presented in an interesting context. I leave this to the museum, because we are not about the content, but it would be very good if this was included in the presentation and became part of the story of the painting. I still have a lot of cups and themes. Actually, I\\'d like to continue with the purchase process.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): So you\\'re shutting down painting and tour now. Then let me see if there are any interruptions to that subject as a result of your answers. That is not the case. That\\'s the case, though. I was already disappointed. Mr Schalk on behalf of the SGP. Go ahead. No, I was sorry there wasn\\'t anything.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): Let me ask you a question about that criss. Mr Van Kesteren asked about wok. Mrs. Prast is asking about that criss. I think we all want to know if we\\'re not gonna put the painting away or something, if someone finds out that that criss came in in a nasty way. I don\\'t think we want to go there. I think that\\'s the question. Can we accept in 2022 that there might be elements in such a painting that we would appreciate in a different way at the moment? Don\\'t we just pull our hands off that part of the art? I think that\\'s the question.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): That\\'s a fair question. I don\\'t think we should. Every time you look at a painting or another work of art, you look at it differently. It\\'s part of a period. It\\'s part of the painting. It\\'s part of the artist. We have to appreciate that and tell it that way. Of course, you can look at it in different ways, but the point is that it\\'s a fantastic painting. We must not let the painting itself fall through all kinds of new ideas or ideas. I think we should separate that from each other. That\\'s part of the painting, too. That story is also part of the art gallery.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Then we continue with the purchase process block, or the purchase process subject I must say.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Mr Pijlman asked: can you clarify the procedure and decision-making on purchases? Who gave the State advice in this case? How does this generally happen when purchasing the purchase fund and special documents such as the one mentioned above? In general, museums determine which works they would like to purchase on the basis of their collection plan. In doing so, they always look for opportunities from external sources, such as private and public funds. A public fund is the purchase scheme of the Mondriaan Fund. When an application for purchase funds is made to the Mondriaan Fund, an opinion is always given by a committee of experts. In case of a positive opinion, a contribution to the purchase amount can be made. In exceptional cases, the National Purchase Fund is used. An application is made by the Mondriaan Fund. In this particular case, where the asking price was so high that it was clear that the funding could not be raised by funds, the help of the Dutch State was invoked by the Rijksmuseum. Mr... now I can\\'t read it very well. Janssen?\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Yes, that\\'s Mr. Janssen, from the SP.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): From the SP. Yes. Sorry, I wrote it very quickly. He asked if I could explain the process between the valuation and the determination of the asking price. I can outline a global timeline. You will understand that all these events took place before I took office as Secretary of State. I\\'m going to paint it for you anyway. In the autumn of 2018, the Rijksmuseum announced that this work would come on the market. In November 2018, the Rijksmuseum had a valuation carried out. In spring 2019, the French Government refused an export licence and entered a 30-month period in which the French government had a first right of purchase. In November 2021, this deadline expired and it became known that there is no buyer in France. Negotiations with the Dutch government and the Rijksmuseum were started. In early December, buyer and seller reached agreement on the price. In December, the House of Representatives agreed to make a contribution and now I ask your Chamber to also agree to release this amount for the purchase of this painting.\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): I\\'m going back to the Secretary of State\\'s introduction. She said there was contact with the seller and then the price was assessed. The essence of my speech was that the asking price ultimately determined the value. By first having contact with the seller and asking how much they wanted for the painting I say it flatly and then assessing whether that is reasonable, the valuer is already biased and has already been given a direction. This is different from the situation in which the valuer objectively assesses the value without knowing what the asking price should be. That\\'s different from what the Secretary of State says now. So my question is whether it is as the Secretary of State said at first. Has there been first contact with the seller and then the valuation took place?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I think this is a fair question. Why don\\'t you give me time to figure it out? I\\'ll come back to it later.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): I have a follow-up question. I understand there\\'s been contact with the seller. Now, let me get this straight: the seller said he wanted 175 million, and then they said, \"Okay, let\\'s see if we can fix that.\" That\\'s what happened, I understand.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): This question is in line with the previous one. I\\'m curious, too. I believe that this was also Mr Otten\\'s question. Shall I see if I can get back to you? They\\'re gonna figure this out anyway. I can imagine that I will now deal with the questions and that, if they remain, we will look for answers and come up with an answer.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Let us then, in accordance with the agreement, let the Secretary of State finish the subject and at the end commit the interruptions.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): I would just like to clarify my question, because this is important. Has it been said that the 30 months of the export license is over, we just called, 175 million, okay, we\\'re gonna do it? Or has there been another negotiation about the price and, for example, did the State say: well, we are offering 100 or 120 million dollars, I\\'m just saying what is going on or has it just agreed to that price right away? Because when the French didn\\'t want it, you could reason that the price had fallen in the market, because a buyer had fallen. My specific question is, also in relation to Mr Janssen\\'s question, whether the price has been negotiated. Or was it said, okay, that\\'s your asking price, then we\\'re gonna settle that?\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you. The Secretary of State will come back to it.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Yes.\\nFrentrop, Paul (FvD): The Secretary of State just said, if I have heard correctly, that the Rijksmuseum had a valuation done in December 2018. On what amount did the valuation come out in December 2018?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): You want me to figure this out and come back to that? I\\'ve seen some numbers, but I\\'d like to mention the right amount.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): I didn\\'t come to the microphone for that, but I think it was 165 million. I\\'m here for something else because the process is being outlined. In April 2019, the Committee on Cultural Heritage in France advises the government, the Minister of Culture, not to issue an export licence. The Minister takes the advice and says: I want to give the French, the Louvre and perhaps French private persons 30 months to buy it. The Rijksmuseum was already interested. I have asked this question before, and now seems like a good time to get an answer to it. In those 30 months, has there been consultation between the Dutch government, whether or not with the Rijksmuseum, and the Louvre or possibly another museum in France, but the Louvre would be eligible to jointly make an offer and thus jointly purchase this painting?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): This question is still being discussed, because that was also your question last year. The questions bother me a little bit. It\\'s just my first debate, so maybe I don\\'t get it yet. I would like to answer the questions first. Then we can see what\\'s left and I can go into new questions.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Yes, so I would once again suggest that Members should have the Secretary of State deal with this subject first and then see if questions have not been answered instead of repeating the questions asked. If you can agree to this, I suggest that we have the Secretary of State first describe the procurement process, and then at the end of that we see which questions have not been answered.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I also asked this to avoid repeating myself.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): That\\'s obvious.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Members of parliament have asked these questions, and I have to deal with them now.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Please continue your speech.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Okay. Mrs Veldhoen asked: what is your response to Gary Schwartz\\'s criticism in NRC? That criticism is about the level of the price of the painting and whether it has a price increase effect on the purchases. The bid is based on the demand price made to the State by the selling party. This is also an answer to questions from others. This was preceded by negotiations conducted by the Rijksmuseum with the seller. The judgment as to whether this was a reasonable price is based on a 2018 valuation report, which the Rijksmuseum has shared with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education. This also includes the opinion and own contribution of the Association Rembrandt. The art market, like other markets, has general upward price effects, so the current price of 175 million is not unreasonable compared to the value of 165 million mentioned in 2018. Such top works are very popular internationally and are sought by collectors from all over the world. Rembrandt, like Vermeer and Van Gogh, we\\'ve just called it a sub-category. These are very valuable. I have just mentioned some prizes, which I will not repeat here again. So the international art dealership is erratic. The prices for the most important unique works of art are difficult to compare one-on-one. The price boosting effect of a single purchase on the price development of old masters in general cannot be determined with certainty. The price and quality of the intended work in a dynamic market will always have to be considered in future purchases. They also asked if I was involved in this purchase as an advisor at the Rembrandt Association. No. The board of the Association Rembrandt and the management of the Rijksmuseum were involved in this purchase. I wasn\\'t involved as an advisor. Mr Schalk of the SGP asked: shouldn\\'t the money of the Rijksmuseum also be regarded as public money? A museum is reserved for purchases based on the museum\\'s collection policy. Museums do this mainly by saving a mix of their own income and any subsidies, supplemented by private and public funds. For this reason, the funds paid by the Rijksmuseum for this purchase are not regarded as public money, in the sense that they come directly from the state budget. Mr Janssen of the SP asked: \"How do we generally deal with this kind of money for art? This cannot continue if we shape our policies. Can we talk about that?\" The banner carrier is an exceptional work. The same applies to the high price. I consider this purchase in a broader perspective and therefore I also have an eye for other special purchases for Collection Netherlands. In addition, there is a whimsical international art market. We just talked about that. As part of the procurement policy, I am in contact with the Mondriaan Fund, museums and other parties, such as the Association Rembrandt. I would like to talk to you about this, too, if it is necessary or desirable. Mrs Prast of the Party for Animals asked: why is the assessment report not attached to the documents? The evaluation report was commissioned by the Rijksmuseum. The Ministry has been able to take confidential note of that assessment report. On the basis of that assessment report, the asking price was found reasonable. Negotiations with the seller are still ongoing. The negotiating position of the State therefore means that the report must certainly remain confidential at this stage. Mrs Prast also asked: if there are no private hijackers on the coast, what\\'s the hurry? The French Minister for Culture has issued an export licence to the current owner of the work. As far as I know, no conditions are attached to this. Therefore, private buyers can also apply. If the Netherlands cannot reach a deal within the agreed exclusivity period, the risk is very real that we are fishing behind the net. Mr Frentrop of the Forum for Democracy asked: what do you think of the fact that former Minister Van Engelshoven did not inform the Forum for Democracy Group beforehand and the other groups did? I told you, I\\'ve just been working in politics for one week today. A lot\\'s really new to me. What is common in the submission of an incidental supplementary budget, you know much better than I do. But I dare say that it is not an everyday occupation for a ruler of Culture to acquire a Rembrandt. I can therefore imagine that my predecessor wanted to make a preliminary assessment of the political feasibility of her proposal. I understand that she has made a personal assessment of the circle of people with whom informal discussions have taken place. I can only say that I am in favour of open cooperation.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I suggest that we get the Secretary of State to finish the issue of the procurement process and then do the interruptions. That\\'s what we just agreed. I understand you have a question, but I\\'d still like to hold on to that agreement. If I allow you to interrupt now, I must allow the others as well. That\\'s fine with me, too, but we\\'ve just agreed on something else. I\\'m gonna hold on to that deal. I see that Mr Janssen is eager to join us. At the next block we can make another appointment, but I suggest we get the Secretary of State to finish this block first. Go ahead.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Mrs Prast asked whether a joint purchase was possible and why the Chamber was not informed. French law prevents France from becoming a shared owner of goods. In 2016, France and the Netherlands joined forces in the purchase of marital portraits Marten and Oopjen. France bought Oopjen and the Netherlands bought Marten. Prior to that, it was examined whether joint acquisition was possible. That was not the case. Mrs Prast also asked why no loan was chosen. The current owner wishes to sell the work. That is why an export licence has been applied for. This makes it possible to sell the work to a party outside French territory. Nor would the position of the Netherlands be based on a structural solution. The work will then remain the property of the current owner. It could decide at some point to sell the work to another party. This would not ensure that the work can be exhibited structurally within the framework of the Netherlands Collection. Mr Pijlman and Mrs Klip asked if I could indicate whether the purchase fund has enough room for manoeuvre to keep doing its job. At present, a significant amount remains in the purchase fund. Several purchases can still be made. As I have already informed you in reply to your parliamentary questions, I expect the final opinion of the Netherlands Collection Committee on the purchase fund in February. On the basis of these conclusions, I will consider to what extent the policy on the purchase fund needs to be adapted. Mr Schalk of the SGP asked if we know what the last owner paid for the painting and what that amount means for the current purchase price. We\\'ve heard a few things. It wasn\\'t known to me. I do know that the purchase price of De Vaandeldrager from 1844 is very difficult to compare with today\\'s art market. In the assessment of the current price, I do not think it has played a role. Then there is the question of whether it would be useful in the future to base a purchase of such size on a single valuation and whether there should be a broader valuation, i.e. multiple valuations, on an investment of such size. The careful appraisal of works of art is a responsibility of the art industry itself. In this case, we rely on the expertise of the Rijksmuseum, including the valuation that this museum has had carried out by a renowned connoisseur of old masters. In addition, we also value the contribution of the Association Rembrandt. Finally, I think it will vary on a case-by-case basis. Mr Atsma of the CDA asked if we should involve the population in drawing up a list of purchases that the government wants to make, rather than having only museums design them. A broad support base for museum purchases is very important, but in practice museums take the initiative. Usually a museum purchase is only possible thanks to the use of public and private funds, including the Association Rembrandt, Friend Foundations and the BankGiro Lottery. The use of public and private resources is not only financially necessary. It is also socially desirable for support for museum purchases. The public is often involved in this through crowdfunding actions. An example of this is the recent purchase of a painting by Emanuel de Witte by the Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar. In the case of De Vaandeldrager, the amount of the required amount and the time available did not lend themselves to a time-consuming crowdfunding action. Mr Otten asked if we could still dissolve the purchase. There is currently no definitive purchase. Actually, that\\'s what Mr. Otten said. Therefore, a SPA, a sale and purchase agreement, will have to be concluded first. That is what the State is currently negotiating on. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Otten also asked whether the title of the painting had been properly investigated. We\\'re sure this is the painting, asked Mr. Otten. The painting was examined by the Rijksmuseum in 2019 prior to the Rembrandt-Velázquez exhibition. That investigation did not give rise to any doubts as to authenticity. I\\'m getting the information that the Rembrandt Research Project has also confirmed its authenticity. In the context of the proposed acquisition, the Rijksmuseum will again carefully inspect the painting on behalf of the State. It shall be inspected again, taking into account the conditions documented in 2019. One more question from Mr. Otten. How does this transaction relate to the government\\'s policy to combat tax avoidance? Why does the State cooperate in such constructions? From the information available to me, it appears that the painting was lawfully transferred by the deceased to a trust established outside the Netherlands a few years ago. As far as I know, the trust and its beneficiaries have no tax relationship with the Netherlands. The State has questioned who the beneficiaries of the selling price of the painting are and how the painting was acquired by them. An answer has been given which gives us sufficient certainty. Against this background, there is no obstacle for the State to proceed with the proposed transaction. Mrs Prast of the Party for Animals asked if there are any other interested people who would like to purchase the painting and if so, how many interested people. The information provided by the Rijksmuseum shows that there were several interested parties. The exact number is unknown to me. Mr Atsma of the CDA also asked whether funds for such purchases could be found via crowdfunding. Again, the purchase of De Vandelbearer is exceptional. The purchase is only possible thanks to the use of private and public resources. In addition to a contribution from the State, I refer again to the contributions of the Vereniging Rembrandt and the Rijksmuseum. The Rijksmuseum Fund consists of private funds, including the Friends of the museum, the BankGiro Lottery and other sponsors. I have just mentioned the example of crowdfunding by the Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar. Due to the amount and the time available, it has not been possible to initiate a crowdfunding action in this case. Mr. Otten also asked if the state attorney was involved in the purchase. The State has not yet used the services of the national attorney. However, legal advice has been sought from another office with which the Empire has an agreement. There may be another question about that, but I can also mention it. It concerns Allen & Overy. That office has also previously given advice on the acquisition of Marten and Oopjen. Mrs Veldhoen van GroenLinks wanted to know what appointments I would make with the Rijksmuseum. The Rijksmuseum will draw up a plan of action for the tour of De Vaandeldrager and I await that plan. As soon as that plan is available, I will inform your Chamber. Mr. Chairman. Then I have the theme...\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): You are now at the end of the purchase process?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Yes.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Right. Then I\\'ll take a look at the time before we do the interruptions. A number of Members have committee meetings, including Mr Frentrop at 6 p.m. Is that right? Then I suggest we suspend for dinner break now. Then we start at 7:00 p.m. with the interruptions about the purchasing process. Then we\\'ve had two out of six cubes. Please also bear in mind that it will take a little longer than planned. This means that it is an in-depth debate. I therefore ask you, with your agreement, to stop your interruptions to the purchase process until after the suspension. We\\'ll start at 7:00.\\nLet me look around to see if there are any interruptions on the purchase process subject, or if those questions come in your second term.\\nFrentrop, Paul (FvD): We have had a period in between, so I would like to return to the answer given by the Secretary of State to my question about the thundering process, to put it this way, that the Minister did it by inspecting all the political groups in advance, except for one. My question was: what did the Secretary of State actually think of that? The acoustics in this room aren\\'t great, so I didn\\'t quite hear you. My suggestion was: if you said that you thought it was a little clumsy, the subject is finished as far as I am concerned. But I didn\\'t get it right whether or not you thought it was clumsy.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I can answer that I am in favour of open communication. I don\\'t see why I don\\'t inform the MPs. Is that enough for you, too?\\nFrentrop, Paul (FvD): Now I have heard it right, but does that mean that you would inform all the groups and not skip one?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I don\\'t know exactly what the trade-off was, but my intention is to communicate with everyone.\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): A quick question. The Secretary of State twice stated that negotiations are still ongoing. I assume that this is about the points and the commas, but it is no longer about the purchase price, because that suggestion will soon be raised when the negotiations are still going on. But I assume it\\'s about side business and not about the amount.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): That\\'s right. It\\'s not about the amount. Indeed, the discussions and developments are mainly about the purchase contract in terms of points and commas, as you just said.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): Of course, there is a lot to ask and say about the purchasing process. I would like to ask one thing for clarification. The Secretary of State said that she was not familiar with the fact that the French are now willing to issue an export licence, provided that the work comes into the public domain. This is what the Rijksmuseum Director said in interviews. I assume those interviews are being read at the Ministry. That would have been for the time of the Secretary of State, but does the Secretary of State have any information that Mr Dibbits\\' statement is incorrect?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I don\\'t have that information.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): Thank you.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Let\\'s talk about the purchasing process. We\\'re just reconstructing it a little bit. A asking price of 175 million has been mentioned. Then it was said: fine, deal, we will. There\\'s no other counteroffer. I think that\\'s for sure by now. Now we see in the letter of intent, which I have here in front of me, that it is extremely friendly to the seller, a very seller-friendly letter or intent, even governed by the law of France, while here we are talking about the Dutch State. Why has there been such indulgent surgery towards the seller? That\\'s one question. The second question is: we see that this goes through all kinds of trusts in the Cook Islands, through Caribbean holding companies and then through Switzerland and Monaco. How do we know for sure we\\'re dealing with the right salesman? Because when a family member says: yes, but sorry, Grandpa promised me that painting, that\\'s not at all... How do we know that painting in that trust in the Cook Islands is actually owned by the people you\\'re transferring that money to now? And should that go wrong... Look, we are not against the purchase, but we do want to make sure that we buy it from the good, from the right holder to the painting, and that, if we wouldn\\'t, we can then as State say: yes, but sorry, this is not our problem, that\\'s on you. Then we want to get rid of it and get our money back.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): The question is clear. The Secretary of State.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): That\\'s a very good question. I understand that legal has already come to light that the person we\\'re buying from is the right person. I would like to give it to the legal department to look at it explicitly. I\\'d like that.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Well, it\\'s kind of fundamental. We buy from a trust in the Cook Islands represented by a Swiss law firm. Then how can you be so 100% sure that we buy it from the good? It may well be that that is not entirely checkable, but then you have to cover it up with that SPA very well, for example that part of the purchase price can be recovered a certain period, an escrow or I know what. There are all kinds of measures for this. I\\'m sure Allen & Overy can advise you very well. That is my advice and actually my question. Why isn\\'t that done?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I can pass this one-on-one opinion on to the legal department. Thank you.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Then we get to the subject of cultural sector, if I\\'m right.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Yes. Mrs Veldhoen, Mrs Klip and Mr Pijlman asked questions about the recovery plan and the resources of the coalition agreement. I have promised to inform the Chamber once the use of the means of government agreement has been further developed. In addition, there is a question from Mr... I see we\\'ve answered that, too. Mrs Veldhoen asked what the Netherlands will do with the European Recovery Fund. There is a resolution calling for 2% of this for the cultural sector. She mentioned the motion by GroenLinks on this subject. Is that right? Yes. In response to that motion, my predecessor referred to the intentions of the new cabinet. In the meantime, the coalition agreement of the cabinet is also there. Today\\'s debate is being held in the House of Representatives. The agreement states that the funds from the Recovery and Resilience Facility, RRF, will be used to finance budgeted and new expenditure from this coalition agreement. As it now stands, the expected revenue is included in the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and cannot be used for new policies. Budgetary and new cultural intensifications from this coalition agreement may be financed by the RRF, but I cannot anticipate the precise design. It is a broader decision-making process by the cabinet. I can\\'t actually answer this because it\\'s wider. I think I\\'ve dealt with the cultural sector. I\\'ll join thezzp\\'ers. Mrs Veldhoen, Mrs Prast, Mr Janssen and Mrs Fiers raised questions and expressed concerns about the position ofzzp\\'ers in the cultural sector in this corona crisis. I understand that very well. People in the cultural sector are vulnerable and severely affected by the crisis. I repeat, therefore, that I will make an effort to strengthen the position ofzzp\\'ers in the cultural sector. I\\'m very happy to have culture again. That was not self-evident, I can tell you. There are manyzzp\\'ers working in the sector who have been able to get back to work since Saturday. I would like to explain to you the support that went specifically to the cultural sector in this crisis. To date, more than 1.8 billion of corona aid has been made available to the cultural and creative sectors. Of these, 333 million were primarily used for schemes forzzp\\'ers, for example through schemes in the State Culture Funds or the Rights Sector Support Fund. This is on top of the regular contribution of 81 million via the Mondriaan Fund to the visual arts and artists. This will also be in addition to the other measures that have been implemented through institutions by a number ofzzp\\'s, such as support to BIS institutions and the event scheme. These resources come on top of the resources such as Tozo and TONK, which have become available in the generic packages forzzp\\'ers. Last December, my predecessor made agreements with the dome of the free theater producers and the Dutch Association for Performing Arts on payment tozzp\\'ers and flexworkers. I would also like to draw your attention to the new compensation scheme at the Podium Kunsten Fund, which, with a budget of 86.5 million to 85%, buys tickets from performances that do not go through the measures. This way,zzp\\'ers can be paid for. Before the end of January, I will send your Chamber the preparation of the fifth specific support package for the cultural sector. There is another question from Mrs Veldhoen: are you going to provide a safety net scheme forzzp\\'ers in culture, as proposed by the Creative Coalition? I don\\'t need to repeat that thezzp\\'ers are having a hard time. I\\'ve seen the Creative Coalition\\'s proposal. It proposes a safety net scheme specifically for the cultural and creative sectors. In the few days I have been in office, I understand that this is a far-reaching proposal which I am making in the area of my colleague in Social Affairs. I can assure you thatzzp\\'ers have my full attention, but it is really too early to have a concrete plan on this after one week in office. So let me develop this over the next few weeks. That is what the creative sector is about. Then the theme is the corona measures. On behalf of GroenLinks, Mrs Veldhoen asks what signal it sends that the IKEA is open, but the museums are not. The cabinet has decided that the shops can be opened. I understand that disappointment very well; of course I also have a museum background. The fact that the museums remain closed is simply disappointing, but I have seen in this crisis that it goes one step at a time. We can\\'t open everything at once. This was possible. In order to limit travel movements, not everything can be opened at the same time. At the next step, culture is already at the top of the agenda. Then I have some general questions, and then I\\'ve had everything. I have a question here from the SP. I think that\\'s Mr. Janssen. A motion has been passed in the Lower House calling on the government to regulate a right of first purchase for art offered for sale by the Royal House. His question is whether I can indicate when the Chamber will be able to see a proposal for the drafting of this motion. In a debate just before the recess, the House of Representatives adopted this motion. I hope you will give me some time to take a good look at the content of this motion and to comment on it. I\\'ll do that before the summer. Then there\\'s another question about the criss on the painting. That\\'s been figured out and come back. Inquire at the Rijksmuseum teaches us that there is no question of a criss. The weapons specialist of the Rijksmuseum indicates that it is a dagger from Europe. They can tell by the button on that dagger. Besides, banners never wore a criss. I hope I have been able to answer the questions about the criss. I think I\\'ve run out of questions. I had something in there somewhere. Oh yes, De Vaandeldrager in the Lower House, Mrs Nanninga asked about that. It is very difficult for me to answer that, but I think that Parliament, the Chamber itself, is about the establishment of the Chamber. I\\'d like to leave it at that. But it is a very original idea and I also think it is a very nice and good question.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Secretary of State. That puts you at the end of your term. Let me see if there are any questions on the side of the Chamber as to whether there are any interruptions at the moment. That is not the case. Then we have arrived at the second term of office. I am happy to give the floor to Mrs Veldhoen on behalf of GroenLinks.\\nVeldhoen, Gala (GL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That just happened fast. Thank you to the Secretary of State for answering all the questions. Firstly, my group welcomes the commitment that the Secretary of State will return to policy for today\\'s makers. That\\'s what she promised. I understand that this has not been formulated in a week, but we hope that this policy will be developed in substance and that we will not be informed about it for too long. We\\'ve spent a lot of time thinking about the purchasing process. What lingers with my group is: there is one batch of bacon buyer throughout the process, and that is the selling party, which actually spins yarn at the desire of the Netherlands to bring this work back to the public domain. That raises the question in my group: can this not be otherwise? Shouldn\\'t you come to agreements with other art-loving European countries with regard to these kinds of works? I mean at least that you are trying to prevent the price from being pushed up in such a way that the seller knows that this is a work that one would like to bring into the public domain, which means that a lot of money goes from the community to one private person or family. The question is whether we should cooperate in this. I would like to call on the Secretary of State to take a look at policy that sees this. Can you reach agreements with other countries to prevent this kind of negotiation from taking place and pay these kind of exorbitant amounts, actually because you want to serve the public interest? Then I have a question about the 2% Earmarks in that recovery fund. I understand that the Secretary of State says: I cannot say anything about that now, because it still needs to be designed; it is part of a broader consideration. However, I would like to ask the Secretary of State: can you promise that you will come back to this and that you will speak in the Cabinet about the ear tags of this money, as the European Parliament has also called for it to do? And can the Secretary of State come back to the Chamber on the outcome of the discussion in this area, as soon as there is clarity about the use of funds from that fund? Then thezzp\\'ers. I paid a lot of attention to it in my first term, because it is something that my group really cares about. Of course, a lot of resources have been allocated to this sector, but that is not for nothing either. That is because this sector is the longest and most densely closed of all sectors in the corona crisis. So I think it is only right that so much money has gone into this sector. That doesn\\'t change the fact that the money didn\\'t end up with the creators. That\\'s concluded after the Boekmanstichting investigated. No matter how much money went, it didn\\'t end up with the creators. That remains a great concern and that is also a great concern of my group. It is certainly also very acidic in the light of the amounts we are talking about today for a single piece of art. My group understands that the Secretary of State cannot at present formulate one-two-three policies to help thosezzp\\'ers. I am glad that she indicates that this subject has its full attention. I can also understand the fact that it is not now able to act in the field of social affairs and that this is interrelated. I would, however, ask the Secretary of State to discuss this, including with Social Affairs, in order to develop policy on this issue and to inform the Chamber. The question to the Secretary of State is whether she would like to give this to us, because it is a very important element for my group in the consideration of this work of art. So I\\'d like an answer to that. I shall conclude by saying that my group is in favour of this purchase. She also sees the importance of obtaining and retaining this work for the Dutch canon. We see that this work is very important, but we still need some answers from the Secretary of State. I\\'d love to wait for that. Thank you.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs Veldhoen. I shall then give the floor to Mrs Prast on behalf of the Animal Party. Do you still need to take your motion? Would you rather I give the floor to the next speaker? No.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): Mr President, thank you. Thank you to the Secretary of State for her answers. I assume that what the Rijksmuseum says about the kris, or about the non-kris, is true. Of course, I didn\\'t come up with this information myself; I had it from two independent sources. One was an article in the magazine Asian Art, based on the exhibition In de ban van de kris. The other was also a scientific article about the work of the old masters, including Rembrandt, and the symbols in it. So I didn\\'t make it up and I\\'m assuming what the Rijksmuseum says is true. Let\\'s assume that. According to the director of the Rijksmuseum, the French have required the export licence to enter the public domain. That is what he said in several interviews and the Secretary of State stated that she does not have information that this is not true. Here too, we assume that what the Rijksmuseum director says is true. This means that there is no competition from private collectors for the purchase of De Vandelbruger. That is very important to us, because in our view it means that the 2018 valuation price is not a reliable starting point for a reasonable price, and because it would mean that there are not many hijackers on the coast and therefore there is no rush to make this decision. So we can think and get some information before we say yes to the bill. To be honest, we feel compelled to decide now, when we do not see the need for it, and I mean the need for haste. The Court must take a decision based on sufficient information. We believe that insufficient information has been given. We assume that\\'s a condition. That means the valuation value can\\'t be right. Then we\\'d like to see a new valuation. We know there\\'s no rush, given the museum director\\'s information. A First Chamber that does its job well cannot, in our view, say yes at the moment. It is not because we would not be in favour of a possible purchase, but because we want to make a very careful decision. I would therefore like to table the next motion. The: The following motion was tabled by Mr Prast: [[Motion]] [[The Chamber,]] [[heard the debate,]] [[Whereas the Court has insufficient information on the reasonableness of the asking price for De Vaandelbearer;]] [[Whereas insufficient consideration has been given to whether the exhibition of De Vaandeldrager in the Netherlands can be carried out in a way that reduces costs (such as joint purchase with another museum, periodic loan or other arrangements);]] [[Calls on the Government to make efforts to ensure that the purchase price is substantially reduced or that initiatives are taken to achieve a joint purchase or contract on a regular basis, with a view to substantially reducing costs;]] [[calls on the Secretary of State to leave the additional budget provided for in the Supplementary Act at the disposal of the Culture budget, after deduction of the costs for De Vaandelblader, in order to use this in particular for provisions which have suffered from the covidpandemic,]] [[and goes to the order of the day.]] [[It seems to me that their submission is sufficiently supported.]] [[She\\'s getting No. kst-35984-F]]\\nI would like to explain briefly. The possibility of loaning is much greater, even in our view, if the painting is to end up in the public domain. That is why we would very much like that possibility to be explored. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs. Prast. Mr Schalk has another question, so you will stand still.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): I tried to get the motion into my head. If I understand correctly, Mrs Prast\\'s intention with this motion is that the purchase cannot go ahead and therefore we cannot actually vote on the legislative proposal before us. Is that a correct observation?\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): The point of the motion is that we cannot say yes at the moment. The thrust of the motion is not that we would never want to buy the banner carrier.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): That\\'s exactly what I meant. The point is that we may be going to buy De Vandelbearer sometime, but tonight we will be voting on this bill. My question to Mrs Prast is whether she wants to make it clear that if her motion is accepted, she will then tell the Secretary of State that the law cannot be put to the vote.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): On that second point... I don\\'t really know.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): If Mrs. Prast read her own motion, she would read...\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): The request is not to confuse. Mr Schalk now has the opportunity to ask his question.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): If Mrs Prast were to read her own motion properly, she would come to the conclusion that she is asking for something which at least makes it impossible for us to reach a decision today on the purchase of the painting. If that is the case, then the motion is now in the right way and we know what to do with it.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): This interpretation is correct.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Moreover, the Chamber itself deals with the agenda and votes and also with whether or not to follow up on motions. I now give the floor to Mr Janssen, who will speak on behalf of the SP Group.\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the Secretary of State for replying. \"The head is off\" is such a nasty expression, but it is. It was a first debate on an important subject. I did hear some nuances from the Secretary of State compared to her predecessor. She said: this possibility of purchase does not occur very often. Her predecessor talked about \"it\\'s now or never.\" I thought that was a pretty tough line. I think this is a better translation. In any case, I hope that the Secretary of State will work within the cabinet to ensure that we do not end up in an atmosphere like \"yes, you just turn on a DVD when the theatres are closed.\" It\\'s hard for me to judge. We are talking about an art market which we can all see has no reason and no reason at the moment. The big money that goes around people for whom money has a different value than for us makes it incredibly complicated to look at it in a good way. The Secretary of State states that the quality of the painting is also a reason for the high price. I find that relationship a little complicated, because the price could have been many times higher if there had been someone who could or could have been on it to hang it on his yacht or otherwise. But it\\'s just the way it is. A motion by my SP colleague, Mr Kwint, has been held in the Lower House, because the predecessor of the Secretary of State has promised to provide an explanation on accessibility for the summer. Mr Schalk asked for this too. You have already been asked for vouchers so you do not have to pay to look at the gift you paid yourself. We await that effect. I understand that the Secretary of State says it\\'s new, but there are a lot ofzzp\\'ers who have been in trouble for a long time and who haven\\'t gotten to all those packages. Mr Veldhoen pointed out that too. Those people take a couple of weeks, too. They really need perspective, other than having an idea in a few weeks\\' time and working on the implementation. They really need something right now. I believe the Secretary of State said that a letter will be sent before the end of this month on new aid packages. She said, \"I\\'ll be on the premises of my colleague from Social Affairs.\" What we do not want is for thezzp\\'ers to get on the ground of the other Minister for Social Affairs, the Minister for Poverty Policy. They don\\'t belong there. Mr. Chairman. I find the whole procurement policy extremely worrying and I think the Ministry should learn from it. The director of the Rijksmuseum spoke to the seller, who mentioned a price. Afterwards, the director of the Rijksmuseum appointed a valuer. I come back every time to the director of the Rijksmuseum who has decided something and the ministry on the side. I think the Secretary of State should look at how this can be done better in the future. I am sure we will be able to talk about this later. As a result, the director had the \"not buying is not an option\" position and he has always said so publicly. That gives the picture of a kid in the candy store with the parents\\' credit card. I don\\'t think that\\'s the right picture. I don\\'t think it should be. That\\'s what needs to be learned. \"Don\\'t buy is not an option\" can\\'t be the starting point if you\\'re going to negotiate a purchase. I will conclude with a motion by Mr Kwint on the right of preference when buying. The Secretary of State said that before the summer a letter will follow on how it will work. I like that commitment. This gives us the opportunity to hold a policy debate after the summer, not only on its implementation, but also on the points made by Mr Veldhoen, Mr Atsma and Mr Frentrop on lists and how we should deal with them, including in our preferred policy. I look forward to any comments from the Secretary of State in second term.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Janssen. Mrs Fiers has the floor on behalf of the Labour Party.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): Secretary of State, thank you for the answer, but I\\'m standing here with a knot in my stomach for the second round. I believe that the answer given by the Secretary of State does not really respond to the substance of my speech. That is because the money for all aid measures did not reach thezzp\\'ers. I\\'ve heard a whole list of corona measures. Of course, they were also included in the answers to the written questions. That\\'s not the point. A lot of money went there, but it doesn\\'t end up in the place where it hurts most, namely with thezzp\\'ers. In my first term, I also indicated that this not only affects thosezzp\\'ers and the families behind it. This also affects the whole sector, because of the large number ofzzp\\'ers. I would like to hear a little more from the Secretary of State in the second term. Does she share the analysis that there is a problem with thezzp\\'ers, because the corona support does not end up there? And then I also have the question: what is she going to do about it? I heard the Secretary of State\\'s commitment that this has her full attention. Now in my daily work I also have full attention to everything. The question is: can we get a superb kick out of that? Secretary of State, what are you gonna do? You will make maximum efforts to ensure that the problem of thezzp\\'ers is solved. You say in your promise: in a few weeks\\' time. But the distress is very high. So I\\'m also looking for the timeline where there can be a solution for thezzp\\'ers. The Secretary of State said in the context of the corona measures: \"We are taking a step-by-step re-opening. On the next step, culture is at the top.\" Maybe she can zoom in a little bit more on what this means. Is culture the first sector to open or not? I\\'d like to get an explanation of that. Mr. Chairman. Finally, the appraisals. The Secretary of State responded by saying that I would rather leave that to the sector. I would nevertheless like to have a reply in the second term of the Secretary of State to what I mentioned, namely that in many other sectors there are requirements for valuations. I\\'d say if someone wanted to buy a house and outbid it horribly, go ahead. But this is about public money. My approach would be that it is not strange for future purchases to impose requirements on the way in which the valuation is carried out. If the Secretary of State feels a little more space when it comes to future purchases, can she make a commitment to that? Maybe just a little bit more. We\\'ve been talking about Anne Ermens and the fantastic artwork she\\'s made. I understand you said I\\'m giving it to the Rijksmuseum to do something nice with it. I hope this is with a warm recommendation.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs Fiers. Mr Schalk has the floor on behalf of the Group of the European People\\'s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): Thank you, Mr President. I would, of course, like to thank the Secretary of State for the answers she has given so far. There have been a number of issues which I would like to say very briefly. We talked about kris and wok. By now we know that the criss has at least been pushed aside. The idea behind that piece of debate was, in my humble opinion, that all kinds of social ideas of today should not be a basis for judging artistic expressions of the time and then banishing them or whatever. When the dagger came in from Europe, I thought for a moment that Mrs Prast\\'s motion was about that. I\\'d still be interested, but with the motion that\\'s on the table right now, I\\'ve got a little less. I\\'ll say something about that in a moment. I understand there\\'s been a very good request for thezzp\\'ers. The Secretary of State has also indicated that this is, of course, partly in the case of Economic Affairs. On the other hand, the pressure from the culture and media must be great to promote that extra. Everyone in this room understands that. However, I would like to put another question to the Secretary of State. If this purchase does not take place, is it the case that the 150 million is not automatically available to the cultural sector? I would like to hear from the Secretary of State what exactly is going on here. Is it just general resources that can go anywhere? Then it could be in Groningen where it ends up. The final point. We talked about the tour and the plan set up by the Rijksmuseum. I have heard that the Secretary of State has said that she will endeavour to ensure that the knowledge of this painting is made possible as cheaply as possible, or perhaps even freely as possible. The Kwint motion from the Lower House is above this debate. We are very curious how this will work out. Finally. I have already made a point about the motion that has just been tabled by Mrs Prast. I can imagine her motion, but at the time of its adoption, the Chamber will have to consider whether or not to vote. If what is called for in the motion becomes a reality, I think we will be coming many months further. In this case, initiatives must be taken to achieve a joint purchase or contract on a regular basis, in order to substantially reduce costs. I guess we\\'ll be up against Santa Claus. In any event, the SGP will not support this motion. The proposal before us supports the group. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Schalk. I call Mrs Klip-Martin on behalf of the VVD Group.\\nKlip-Martin, Tanja (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to begin by thanking the Secretary of State for her comprehensive answer to all our questions. I think your baptism of fire has been very successful with regard to the VVD. Thank you for that. Mr. Chairman. I come back to one question, just to say that we welcome the response of the Secretary of State. We are curious about the government\\'s vision of the future role of the National Museum Purchase Fund. Yes, we will be hearing about that. On behalf of the VVD Group, I would like to endorse what Mr Schalk said. The fact that we are now looking at history differently should not have the effect of sweeping things that were made in those times or putting them behind a thick closet door. They should be the reason to talk about that past and see how we deal with such developments more wisely and differently in the future. Even after this debate, the VVD Group fully supports the purchase of De Vaandelblader by the State of the Netherlands. I said that in my first term. We will not support Mrs Prast\\'s motion. I\\'ll get one line out of that. In the first sentence it says: little or insufficient information on the reasonableness of the asking price. The VVD Group is in the same vein as I said in my contribution: the government is not an assessor of art and culture. Those are the experts. This applies not only to the quality of the piece or the positioning in art and culture history, but also to pricing. We have specialists for that too. Thank you.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mrs. Klip. I now give the floor to Mr Van Kesteren on behalf of the PVV Group.\\nvan Kesteren, Ton (PVV): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank the Secretary of State for answering the questions asked. I found her debut refreshing. But now to the reflection. Mr. Chairman. The intended edition for this Rembrandt is disproportionate. The amount is disproportionate because it is in no way proportionate to the amounts spent on art and culture, to social needs, for example, tozzp\\'ers working in this sector. As an example, I also mentioned the thousands of Groningen people who were duped by gas extraction, who, with 53 000 in number in vain, used a similar amount to improve their homes. The amount is disproportionate because it encourages an overstretched market and a stimulating effect, especially as regards similar works of art that we would like to purchase or purchase in the future because of the Dutch cultural heritage. In conclusion, I have two more questions for the Secretary of State. What is the position of the Secretary of State on the suggestion that the exclusivity clause should be applied so that everything can be sorted out again? That therefore does justice to the scepticism expressed in this Chamber. Perhaps that will give the State a new and better negotiating position. I would like to hear the views of the Secretary of State on this. The second question, finally. King Willem II was a passionate art collector, who bought everything that was loose and stuck, including a respectable number of Rembrandts. These purchases were an attempt on the treasury. After his death, much of this art was sold again, so that much cultural heritage disappeared from our country. The Secretary of State noted in her answer to the questions that once acquired art, like this Rembrandt, will never be sold again. My question to the Secretary of State is: are these guarantees even to be given, given the example I have just given here? Is there any guarantee for that at all? I doubt it. Thank you.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Van Kesteren. I now give the floor to Mr Pijman, on behalf of the D66 Group.\\nPijlman, Henk (D66): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am glad that I always come after Mr Van Kesteren, because then everyone can see that there are different views in the Chamber. The situation at the time with the Oranges and the Rembrandts is quite different from how the State functions now. But this aside. Thank you, Secretary of State, for answering the questions and the commitment to return to the purchase fund. I said it myself, and you illustrated it once again: the Dutch State has been very supportive of the cultural sector during the coronapandemic. Also thezzp\\'ers, I say to Mrs. Fiers. They also benefited from the Tozo scheme. The point is that it is now over and that this group of people, who are very important to the sector, is very much in trouble. That\\'s got all your attention. You\\'re gonna consult with Social Services, because that\\'s where it belongs. We hope, however, that you and your colleagues in the cabinet will find a solution. We want to make that plea, too. We also understand that that\\'s how you\\'re going to do it. Finally. Of course, we will not support Mrs Prast\\'s motion for the Animal Party. That would mean that you didn\\'t buy the painting, and that\\'s exactly what we\\'re here for. Thank you.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Arrowman. Mr Otten has the floor on behalf of the Otten Group.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Mr. Chairman. As I have said several times today, we are not in principle against the purchase of De Vaandelblader, although we think the price is very high. We can see why that\\'s happening now. The Rothschild family asked for 175 million. The State said, under pressure from the Rijksmuseum, deal. Yeah, you\\'re gonna pay the grand prize. I have a few specific questions. What is the next step in this process? The Secretary of State also spoke about the sale and purchase agreement. My question to the Secretary of State is what exactly is the status of that right now. What is the timing to sign the sale and purchase agreement? And what is the timing of the planned closing, whereby the painting is delivered and paid for? Can we as the First Chamber see this sale and purchase agreement, whether confidential or not, just like the letter or intent? Mr. Chairman. Our advice is to structure this transaction better, to showcase a little more \"brinkmanship\" in the negotiations and not to do everything the seller asks for, out of the unfounded fear that the painting might otherwise be missed. I would also like to draw the attention of the Secretary of State to the last sentence of Article 6 of the letter of intent. There\\'s enough leads in there to do what I just suggested. There is still a lot of flexibility on the deadline. I\\'d say read that Article 6. More importantly, the current deal structure actually means that the Netherlands is transferring 175 million to some kind of trust on the Cook Islands. I\\'ve just looked it up: they\\'re near Tonga, the island just hit by a volcano eruption. The money goes to the Cook Islands, and that\\'s it. Should problems arise later, for example because there is something going on with the painting or with the ownership relationships within the family: pity then, money gone. We don\\'t think that\\'s very careful. We are talking about a lot of money, about taxpayers\\' money, at some difficult time, also for the cultural sector. That is why we have the next motion, which I shall now read out, Mr President. The: Mr Otten and Mr De Vries tabled the following motion: [[Motion]] [[The Chamber,]] [[heard the debate,]] [[Whereas the Dutch State intends to purchase the painting De Vaandelbearer van Rembrandt and to use 150 million tax dollars for that purpose;]] [[noting that it is essential for the Dutch State that this purchase of De Vaandelbearer is accompanied by as many legal guarantees and guarantees as possible and to ensure that the State agrees with the seller sufficient opportunities to claim effective compensation from the seller if those guarantees and guarantees are not fulfilled;]] [[requests the Government to adapt the contractual agreement (so-called SPA) with the seller in such a way that the Dutch State is given sufficient legal protection by the seller,]] [[and goes to the order of the day.]] [[It seems to me that their submission is sufficiently supported.]] [[She\\'s getting No. kst-35984-G]]\\nI see another question, Mr President.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Yeah, me too. But are you with that at the end of your input?\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Well, we look forward to the Secretary of State\\'s answers to our remaining questions. And of course we are very curious about Mr Janssen\\'s question.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): And that puts you at the end of your input?\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Yeah, I\\'ll be at the end. I can see I\\'ve run out of time.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I shall now give the floor to Mr Janssen.\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): A brief clarifying question on the motion, in particular the operative part. Mr Otten asks for the sale and purchase agreement to be amended, but we do not yet know the sale and purchase agreement. Adapting something we don\\'t know yet seems complicated to me. Would it be enough for Mr Otten, I ask, because I understand what he means if the Secretary of State promises to take care of all the points he is concerned about? In fact, as the operative part is now worded, it is becoming very complicated to amend something of which I do not yet know the basic text.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): It calls for this text to be looked at. That would help a lot. But I would like to say something about that. The LoI says that the painting \"to the best of our knowledge\" is real. I won\\'t go into details, but that\\'s a pretty weak guarantee. If you pay that much money, it is common for you to get tough guarantees that, if there is something wrong, that is on the account of the selling party and not on the account of the buyer. Especially if the money disappears to the Cook Islands or I know where, because then you can whistle for that money. It will all be done in good faith, I assume, but with this kind of money you have to take care of it very businesslike. I would like to amend the motion in the sense that we are asking to ensure at least that such a mechanism is included, if it is not yet in place. But studying the LoI gives me reason to assume that this does not quite end up in the SPA. That is my answer to Mr Janssen.\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): Do I understand Mr Otten correctly that he says: I have expressed the concerns in the recitals and I want them properly covered in the sale and purchase agreement?\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Yeah, well, then you understand. Then I\\'d like to change the motion if necessary. I understand the vote is scheduled for tonight. Then our proposal is to vote on the motions for resolutions this evening. If we can vote on 175 million, I think we can also vote on a few motions. I would like to combine that with the vote on the proposal.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I will make a proposal on this later tonight. It is customary to put the motions to the vote a week later, so that the political groups have the opportunity to discuss them again. If the Chamber decides otherwise, we\\'ll do it differently. But it\\'ll come up later tonight. I\\'ll put that question to the Chamber.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Or I would ask that the whole vote, including the purchase, be postponed until next week.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): The Chamber is about the agenda.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Okay.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I will make a proposal on this tonight. Moreover, at the request of the committee, the agenda already states that the legislative proposal will be voted on this evening. It\\'s already been decided. I now turn to Mr Atsma, who will speak on behalf of the CDA.\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): Thank you, Mr President. I was thinking about that three-hour train trip and I see all this happening here... Mr Otten asked his questions about the purchase now. We have outlined it in a slightly broader context, and we have strongly insisted on the need for a railway book or a road map in the event of future purchases from abroad or inland countries, as this could very well be done. We have said: avoid any ad hoc policy. We are not in favour of the motions, but in that sense we would like the Secretary of State\\'s undertaking to give this consideration and to inform the Chamber of what this railway book will look like in the future when such matters arise. That is a matter of care, and that is something that fits in with this Chamber. Mr. Chairman. I also indicated that it would be good to think about crowdfunding. Of course, I did not mean that with retroactive effect, but I did say that you could think about it in the future if that is not an option. I referred to Project Rembrandt: more than 1.5 million viewers a week later. Between Kunst and Kitsch: another example of 1.5 million viewers. The point is that there is an interest in this subject and, therefore, support for it. In this sense, I am very pleased with the confirmation of the Secretary of State that this painting may also take a tour of the provinces along the provincial capitals. We have also called for this in the case of Marten and Oopjen. Nothing else has come of that, but we hope that it will happen in this case. The CDA Group does not support the motion of the Party for Animals. I share the views of some people in this Chamber that if that motion is taken seriously, you will have to vote on it today, otherwise we will also be in danger of falling into ad hoc policy ourselves. Suppose today the proposal is adopted and next week the motion: I do not think that is possible. So we need to be clear about this motion first. Thank you.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Mr. Atsma. Then we are at the end of the second term of office. I give the floor to Mr Schalk for an interruption.\\nSchalk, Peter (SGP): No interruption for Mr Atsma, excuses for that, but perhaps a point of order, if that is allowed. I think Mr Otten has just made an interesting point, but he also indicated that he was prepared to amend his motion. Do we get a modified motion at that point? For he has said something different than what is now in the motion, by Mr Janssen\\'s intervention.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I have not yet heard Mr Otten table an amended motion. If he so wishes, he could do so in the second term. It\\'ll come in place of his previous motion. If Mr Otten does not wish to do so, then we are not going to do so. I see that Mr Otten would like to table an amended motion. I am happy to give the floor to Mr Otten. I call Mr Otten. Go ahead.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Mr. Chairman. I shall try to amend the motion in such a way that it reflects what Mr Janssen and others have said. I propose that the operative part be adapted to the text: calls on the Government to ensure that the contractual agreement, known as SPA, offers sufficient legal protection to the Dutch State. I am looking at Mr Janssen. Is that gonna get him out of his way? It is about the effect that is intended, not about...\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I am going to ask Mr Otten to table the whole amended motion again, so that we know for sure, including in the Acts, what we are talking about now, because I have the impression that it is not yet fully carried out.\\nJanssen, Rik (SP): Perhaps a suggestion to Mr Otten: if he replaces the words \"to adapt\" by \"to shape,\" it says \"the government requests that the contractual agreement with the seller be given sufficient legal protection against the seller.\" Then I think that covers what I indicated earlier.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): I see Mr Otten writing. We\\'ll just wait and see.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Then I\\'ll rewrite the whole motion. That\\'s the modified motion 35984, letter G.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): No, no, no. We\\'re gonna change the number for the motion.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Yeah, but this is the motion we\\'re talking about right now.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): You\\'re coming with a new motion. What\\'s the new motion?\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): So that\\'s the modified motion on the previous one.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): The motion-Otten c.s. (\\' point \\') has been amended to read as follows: The Chamber, heard the debate, Whereas the Dutch State intends to purchase the painting De Vaandelbearer van Rembrandt and to use 150 million tax dollars for that purpose; noting that it is essential for the Dutch State that this purchase of De Vaandelbearer is accompanied by as many legal guarantees and guarantees as possible and to ensure that the State agrees with the seller sufficient opportunities to claim effective compensation from the seller if those guarantees and guarantees are not fulfilled; requests the Government to give the contract (so-called SPA) to the seller in such a way that the Dutch State is given sufficient legal protection by the seller, and goes to the order of the day. It seems to me that their submission is sufficiently supported. She gets letter H, was letter G ().\\nI give the floor to the Secretary of State for Culture and Media.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Mr. Chairman. I suggest I answer the questions first and then deal with the motions. Several MPs have asked for commitments on a list of works of art to be purchased and the procedures for purchasing works of art for the State. My answer to that is as follows. My predecessor asked the Netherlands Collection Committee of the Council for Culture to draw up a vision on the dynamic Netherlands Collection. I expect this advice next February. The committee will advise on the national purchase fund and the procedures for purchases. I can assure you that I will share my policy response to this opinion with your Chamber. Mrs Veldhoen van GroenLinks asked me: can we not come to agreements with other art-loving countries in order not to raise prices; can we make policies on this? I find this an interesting suggestion. I will involve this idea in future policy making on this subject. Mrs Veldhoen van GroenLinks asked about the 2% RRF if I could come back to the impact of the funds. Yes, the parliament will be informed. Members Veldhoen van GroenLinks and Fiers van de PvdA say that the corona supports do not end up with the zzp\\'ers. I would like to stress once again that I see the difficult position ofzzp\\'ers in this crisis. The government agreement includes the need to improve the labour market position ofzzp\\'ers. That is what I am committed to this period. The plans I will develop for this, I will share with your Chamber. The Boekmanstichting\\'s investigation, which states that the corona support does not reach thezzp\\'ers, dates from May 2021 and deals mainly with the impact of the first specific support package in 2020. In the various specific support packages, more and more attention has been paid to thezzp\\'ers since then. I have already mentioned a number of examples, including the compensation scheme for the Performing Arts Fund, with a budget of over 86 million. This regulation is new and must really ensure that the funds reach thezzp\\'ers. My elaboration of the fifth package of support for culture will come this month, and the payment will follow as soon as possible. Support forzzp\\'ers is incredibly important. Indeed, as you said, a very large proportion of the people working in the sector do so as self-employed in the cultural sector. Mrs Fiers of the PvdA asked: can we not make further demands on the sector for future assessments? Indeed, I believe that the art industry has its own responsibility with regard to the handling of valuations. She really has a responsibility of her own, but I am sure to bring your suggestion to your attention during my discussions with the sector, with a view to the future. Mr Schalk of the SGP asks whether it is true that if the purchase does not take place, the 150 million will not automatically be available for the cultural sector. That\\'s right. If the bill is passed, we are only authorized to use the funds for this purchase. The resources are not available for any other purpose. Mr Van Kesteren of the PVV asked if we can guarantee that this painting will never come on the market again. In theory it is possible to sell the painting again, but this purchase is an important addition to the Netherlands Collection. We\\'re going through a lot of trouble to buy it. So it is not obvious to sell this painting again. Mr Van Kesteren also asked me how I stand on the suggestion that the exclusivity clause should be applied in order to get things straight. If we allow the exclusivity clause to expire, there is a good chance that the selling party will start a purchasing process with another party. In that case, we are no longer at the negotiating table and there is a high risk that we will not be able to buy the work. Mr Otten of the Otten Group asked me what the next step in the process is, what the status of the sale and purchase agreement is and whether the Chamber can see this agreement. I can\\'t comply with the request. The buy isn\\'t finished yet. This purchase also requires your Room\\'s agreement. Negotiations on the SPA are still ongoing. It is important that these can take place on the basis of confidentiality. I cannot share the contents of the SPA without the consent of the seller.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Mr Otten wants to ask another question about this.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): I also asked what the timing of the steps is. When is the drawing of the SPA provided and when is the closing and delivery of the painting and the payment of the purchase price? The Secretary of State hasn\\'t said anything about that yet.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I can\\'t tell you in detail about the timing, but it\\'s quick: in a few weeks. Well, if I remember correctly, I can check it again, uh, that\\'s somewhere in now and three, four weeks.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Yes, but of course we have signing and closing. The SPA is signed at some point. Then there\\'s usually a few more weeks in which you prepare everything. So you\\'re saying that in a few weeks the painting will be delivered and the money will be paid. Let me get this straight.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): If I say it right, the timing is that the SPA will be there in two weeks. For the closing, for the entire rounding of the route is allocated between now and about four weeks.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Okay, that\\'s very good news, because then our motion could have a positive impact on shaping the SPA. That\\'s very good.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Then Mrs. Prast\\'s motion to letter F. As far as this motion is concerned, I would first like to correct something. It is not the case that the French Government would have made the condition that De Vandelbearer should remain in the public domain. However, the French Government has said that it would like the work to remain open to the public. But the seller is free to sell the work to any interested party. I would like to comment on the consideration that it has not been sufficiently investigated whether the exhibition of De Vaandelblader can be cheaper by means of a joint purchase or loan. A loan is not involved because the seller simply wants to sell the work. Then it would depend on another buyer or who wants to give the work on loan. In such an expensive job, the question is whether it is. Buying together with another country is very complex, so we know about the purchase of Marten and Oopjen. After all, countries all have their own rules and directives in this area. I therefore advise against this motion. Moreover, at this stage of the process, there is no question of negotiating the price. There is a preliminary purchase agreement based on a price. If it\\'s broken open, the whole process will be open again. Then the modified motion otten to letter H. I would like to stress that there is absolutely no doubt about the authenticity of the work, not by experts and not by advisers. There\\'s no doubt about that. Mr Otten seemed to suggest that. The content of the motion is included in the further development of the SPA. I shall therefore leave the motion to the Chamber.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you, Secretary of State. That puts you at the end of your second term? Yeah?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Um... yeah. I don\\'t know what to do anymore, Mr. Chairman. Do I get questions, sit down, walk away?\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): You don\\'t have to do anything. You are at the end of the answer in this period?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Yeah, yeah.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): That\\'s right. Mrs Veldhoen then has a question for you.\\nVeldhoen, Gala (GL): Thank you to the Secretary of State for replying. You say about the situation of thezzp\\'ers: it is an investigation of the Bookman Foundation from May \\'21. We have, of course, also received letters from the Creative Coalition which show that the situation is much more acute than it was when that investigation was carried out. Now the question is: is it not wise to ask the Boekmanstichting again to carry out research and now the current situation? We are getting signals that it is even worse than when that investigation was carried out. Then you will have more reason to take steps there and then you would know where to do that. That is my specific question: should the Boekmanstichting not be asked to re-examine the situation ofzzp\\'ers and whether the aid has actually ended up there or not?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I think it\\'s a very good idea to ask. It\\'s a very good plan to ask the Bookman Foundation.\\nVeldhoen, Gala (GL): Thank you very much for that answer. Can we do that in the short term? Zzp\\'ers now have a problem, so if months go by, that is of course problematic again. I imagine we\\'re asking for a brief update on that earlier investigation. Is the Secretary of State prepared to speed this up immediately, so that there will be answers in the short term?\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): It must be done in the short term, because the situation is rather acute, so: yes.\\nAtsma, Joop (CDA): As regards the explanation of Mr Otten\\'s motion, you indicated that you would take the contents of the motion with you in the further discussions. You then say \"judge chamber.\" Isn\\'t the motion really superfluous? You have already admitted that you will consider part of the contents of the motion.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): Yeah, I\\'m taking it, so I guess so.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): No, it is true that the negotiating position of the Dutch State will be greatly improved if that motion is adopted, because then the Secretary of State has an objective fact: there is a request to amend it a little bit. On the contrary, this could greatly benefit the negotiations. I would like to say to Mr Atsma that this is a positive thing.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): I have one more clarifying question about the valuations. The Secretary of State says: I think the sector has its own responsibility. But I\\'d like to hear her reflection on the fact that it\\'s about public money. You could say that the moment we invest together, we make demands; whatever else you do, you have to know for yourself. I just want to reflect on the fact that this is about public money.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I understand the question very well. It\\'s also the art business. Of course, we work with advisors. As for discussing it with the sector... yes, let me take this with me.\\nFiers, Mary (PvdA): It\\'s fine to discuss with the sector: how do we do that smartly? It is not that you should think in the ivory tower: how then? But I think it\\'s going to help us with future purchases if we know what conditions have been given in front. I think that will also make the debate easier in the future, with any subsequent purchases.\\nUslu, Gunay (D66): I can only confirm this.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Thank you. It\\'s a bit noisy in the room. Nevertheless, I shall close the debate.\\nI\\'ve come to deal with the bill, the \"closing\" for Mr. Otten. Does one of the Members wish to vote on the bill? That\\'s the case. I propose that the legislative proposal be voted on shortly after a brief suspension. Then on the motions: it is customary for us to vote next week on the motions that have been tabled. I understand, however, that Mrs Prast is the first to wish to speak. Then I will also give the floor to Mr Otten with a request on the motion, namely to do something other than put to the vote next week.\\nPrast, Henriëtte (D66): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I\\'d like to make an order proposal. I suggest we put the motion to the vote first, so tonight, and for the bill.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): It\\'s actually two steps. You propose that instead of voting on the motion tonight next week, you should vote before the vote on the legislative proposal. Pursuant to Rule 106 of the Rules of Procedure, the Chamber must give leave to do so, in particular for the first time on the motion. I would like to look around to see if the Chamber can agree to that or if anyone has any objections or wishes to vote on that order proposal. I note that the Chamber can agree to that. Then we will vote on Mrs. Prast\\'s motion, motion F, and then on the bill immediately after that brief suspension. I now give the floor to Mr Otten, who would like to ask for or propose something about his motion H, the amended motion.\\nOtten, Henk (FvD): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also have an order proposal. I propose that the amended motion H (35984) also be put to the vote this evening and also before the legislative proposal.\\nBruijn, Jan Anthonie (VVD): Can the House accept this proposal? That\\'s the case. Then, after a brief suspension, we shall vote on motion F and then on motion H of Mr Otten. You can discuss your voting behaviour on both motions and the bill in the suspension with your group. I\\'ll take a look around. My proposal is to suspend for ten minutes. Do you have sufficient time to discuss this with your group? I do not yet hear unanimity, but at least I shall suspend until 8.50 p.m.', 'labels': ['geopolitics', 'technology', 'climate', 'energy', 'security', 'defence'], 'scores': [0.17406964302062988, 0.16985245048999786, 0.16809895634651184, 0.16525328159332275, 0.16312257945537567, 0.1596030592918396]}\n"
